For the last several months, they thought everything was fine. But last week, their homeowners association threatened to sue if they didn't remove the ramp because the family didn't get permission and approval first. \n \n Charlotte Broadnax, Michael Broadnax's wife, said since Channel 4's story first aired on Monday, she has received dozens of calls and letters expressing support for her and her husband. \n \n \"I've had several people come to my door in support,\" Charlotte Broadnax said. \n \n Wednesday, Michael Broadnax came out of intensive care after his latest brain surgery.

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File) \n \n Earlier this week at the World Conference of Science Journalists in Seoul, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Tim Hunt laid this on the audience during his remarks: \u201cThree things happen when they are in the lab.... You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticize them, they cry.\" \n \n Hunt, who won the 2001 Nobel Prize in medicine for his work on cell division and now works for Cancer Research UK, wasn't talking about whiny, distracting lab puppies. He was talking about women. \n \n He went on to say that he thought people should work in gender-segregated labs but that he hoped such sentiment wouldn't \"stand in the way of women.\" \n \n The reaction in the science and science journalism community has been, well, about what you'd expect. I'm not going to embed any tweets, but my favorite lighthearted takes on the subject have been to the effect of well to be fair, most female scientists have a 'no Tim Hunt' policy in their labs and but where will we get that male co-author we're supposed to have if the lab is all female?! \n \n [Sexism in science: Peer editor tells female researchers their study needs a male author] \n \n Outside the Twittersphere, the Royal Society distanced itself from Hunt's remarks, reiterating its commitment to help women succeed in the sciences. \n \n And why are Hunt's feelings so troubling? Well, there's this problem we've got where women are underrepresented in the sciences, math, technology and engineering. In fact, in Britain (Hunt's home country) only 13 percent of people working in STEM are women. In science academia, 84 percent of full-time professors in the field are men.

It is important to eliminate the use of corporal punishment in both public schools and private schools, which serve students receiving federal services, as well as assist in creating a safer learning environment for every child. Instead, we urge policymakers to ensure that our schools are places where students and educators interact in positive ways that foster students\u2019 growth and dignity. \n \n More than 109,000 students were subjected to corporal punishment in public schools in the 2013-14 school year \u2014down from 163,333 in the 2011-12 school year. Despite the decline in instances and the many problems associated with the hitting or paddling of students, corporal punishment is a legal form of school discipline in 19 states. Corporal punishment is often used for a wide range of misbehaviors; for example, 37 percent of corporal punishment used in North Carolina during the 2013-14 school year were for minor or subjective offenses like \u201cbus misbehavior, disrespect of staff, cell phone use, inappropriate language and other misbehaviors.\u201d Aside from the infliction of pain and physical injury that often result from the use of physical punishment, these violent disciplinary methods impact students\u2019 academic achievement and long-term well-being. Harsh physical punishments do not improve students\u2019 in-school behavior or academic performance.

King Jr. is urging governors and school leaders in states that allow student paddling to end a practice he said would be considered \u201ccriminal assault or battery\u201d against an adult. \n \n King released a letter Tuesday asking leaders to replace corporal punishment with less punitive, more supportive disciplinary practices that he said work better against bad behavior. \n \n More than 110,000 students, including disproportionate numbers of black and disabled students, were subjected to paddling or a similar punishment in the 2013-14 school year, said King, citing the Education Department\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection. \n \n Corporal punishment is legal in 22 states. \n \n \u201cThe practice has been clearly and repeatedly linked to negative health and academic outcomes for students,\u201d King said during a conference call with reporters. \u201cIt is opposed by parent organizations, teachers unions, medical and mental health professionals and civil rights advocates as a wholly inappropriate means of school discipline.\u201d \n \n Coming toward the end of President Obama\u2019s term, the push to end corporal punishment builds on the administration\u2019s \u201cRethink Discipline\u201d campaign to create safe and supportive school climates, King said. It also lines up with Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative, meant to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color, he said. \n \n Eighty organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, NAACP, Association of University Centers on Disabilities and American Federation of Teachers, signed an open letter released by the National Women\u2019s Law Center supporting an end to the practice. Students are regularly paddled for minor or subjective infractions like dress code violations, cellphone use or disrespecting staff, the letter said. \n \n \u201cCorporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it\u2019s time we do the same for our nation\u2019s schoolchildren,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves of the Women\u2019s Law...\n\n\nArticle:  Education Secretary John King speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 29, 2016. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) \n \n U.S. Education Secretary John King is urging school districts nationwide to stop hitting and paddling students, saying corporal punishment is \u201charmful, ineffective, and often disproportionately applied to students of color and students with disabilities.\u201d \n \n In a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter being issued Tuesday, King asks educators to \u201celiminate this practice from your schools, and instead promote supportive, effective disciplinary measures. \n \n \u201cThe use of corporal punishment can hinder the creation of a positive school climate by focusing on punitive measures to address student misbehavior rather than positive behavioral interventions and supports,\u201d King writes. \u201cCorporal punishment also teaches students that physical force is an acceptable means of solving problems, undermining efforts to promote nonviolent techniques for conflict resolution.\" \n \n Recent research suggests that more than 160,000 children in 19 states are potential victims of corporal punishment in schools each year, with African-American children in a few southern school districts about 50% more likely than white students to be smacked or paddled by a school worker. \n \n The prevalence of corporal punishment in schools has been steadily dropping since the 1970s, according to findings published last month by the Society for Research in Child Development, a Washington, D.C.-based policy group. \n \n Half of states banned school corporal punishment between 1974 and 1994, but since then, researchers say, only a handful more states have followed suit. \n \n University of Texas researcher Elizabeth Gershoff and a colleague found that 19 states still allow public school personnel to use corporal punishment, from preschool to high school.

In a letter to governors and state school chiefs, King says 22 states\u2014mostly in the South and West\u2014still allow corporal punishment or don't forbid it. He implores them to stop the \"harmful\" and \"ineffective\" practice, saying it teaches kids that getting physical is OK to solve problems. He also points out that some corporal punishment taking place in schools would be considered criminal assault or battery in real-world settings. About 80 groups\u2014including the NAACP\u2014lent their support to a similar letter penned Monday by the National Women's Law Center, reports CBS News. \"Corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it's time we do the same for our nation's schoolchildren,\" an NWLC rep says. King also notes that physical punishment isn't applied equitably to all students. For example, even though black students make up about 16% of attendees in public elementary and secondary schools, they're on the receiving end of one-third of the corporal punishment. Boys are subjected to 80% of such acts, while students with disabilities also tend to be victims more so than other students. \"These data and disparities shock the conscience,\" King writes.

A California woman came forward this week to say a man who\u2019s been accused of dining and ditching on the bill with two other women also did it to her. \n \n As she scrolled through her text messages with Paul Gonzales, the woman, who asked to be identified as Beth, said she thought she was just going on a typical blind date. \n \n Gonzales asked if she was available for dinner over the weekend, and she said yes. Beth, who wanted to protect her identity, said she met Gonzales on the dating app Bumble. There, he called himself Dave Gonzales.

She only had to pay for his glass of wine. She now hopes this doesn\u2019t happen again to another unsuspecting date. \n \n What she wants is \u201cfor him to stop doing this to people. It\u2019s just disgusting.\u201d \n \n Copyright 2017 KCAL/KCBS via CNN. All rights reserved.\n", "completion": "Paul Gonzales' approach to dating is similar to that of many men. He meets women online and invites them out to dinner. But here's where he allegedly diverges: According to CBS Los Angeles, 44-year-old Gonzales has been dining and dashing at area restaurants, leaving behind unsuspecting women he's asked out on blind dates. CBS reported in August that Gonzales had left two women to pay the bill after walking out on restaurant dates last summer. One of the women described how he'd eaten $100 worth of food at a restaurant in Long Beach\u2014explaining he had to order two entrees because he's a bodybuilder\u2014before saying he was going to the bathroom. She never saw him again. Now, the man Grub Street identifies as perhaps \"the world's worst dinner date\" appears to have struck again. A woman, identified by WTOL as Beth, says she met \"Dave Gonzales\" on Bumble before agreeing to dinner at a restaurant in Pasadena. Gonzales ordered \"a glass of pinot, a Caesar salad with a side of shrimp, a steak, and a baked potato\" and ate most of the meal before excusing himself to take a phone call, Beth says. He never returned, a text went unanswered, and his Bumble profile was later removed, adds Beth, who soon after learned of Gonzales' alleged notoriety. She says she wants his \"disgusting\" ruse to stop. According to police, Gonzales has also walked out of a salon, still clad in a smock, without paying for a haircut and color. He's wanted on two bench warrants as a result of misdemeanor charges, including petty theft. (This blind date was more shocking.)<|endoftext|>"}

Polyphenols degradation in cocoa beans during roasting is crucial to the flavour outcome and it is influenced by factors such as temperature, time and pod storage. Antioxidants are compounds that help to inhibit oxidation reactions caused by free radicals such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite thereby preventing damage to the cells and tissues. Their mechanisms of action include scavenging reactive oxygen and decreasing localised oxygen concentration thereby reducing molecular oxygen\u2019s oxidation potential, metabolising lipid peroxides to non-radical products and chelating metal ions to prevent generation of free radicals in humans. The study aimed at investigating changes in total polyphenols, anthocyanins, o-diphenols and antioxidant activity (free-radical scavenging activities) after roasting of pulp preconditioned and fermented cocoa beans using standard analytical methods. A 4\u00d74 full factorial design with the principal experimental factors as pod storage time (0, 3, 7 and 10 days) and roasting duration (0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes) at 120oC were used to study the changes in the total polyphenols, anthocyanins, o-diphenols and % free-radical scavenging activities of the cocoa beans.

The findings will be detailed by researchers from Belgium's Ghent University and the University of Ghana at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver, and center around how antioxidant-rich the sweet is. As a press release explains, it all comes down to tweaking the process. Cocoa beans are removed from pods, fermented in baskets, sun-dried, and then roasted. It's during that last step, the roasting, that polyphenols, which act as antioxidants, are partially lost. In a bid to up the polyphenol content, researchers added a nontraditional step that \"makes our research fundamentally different,\" explains Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa: pulp preconditioning. That simply means they stored the pods\u2014in the case of their experiments, for zero, three, seven, or 10 days\u2014before removing the beans and beginning the fermentation process. A sweet pulp rests between the pod and the beans, and Afoakwa believes the preconditioning gives the pulp time to affect those beans. Indeed, the researchers found that those stored for a week showed the highest antioxidant activity after roasting\u2014which they also adjusted. Rather than heat the beans for the typical 10 to 20 minutes at 248-266 degrees, they lowered the temp to 242 and upped the roasting time to 45 minutes, and discovered that slower and lower was also best in terms of antioxidant activity.

Before Kellyanne Conway became Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager during the homestretch of the race, Conway had publicly criticized candidate Trump for refusing to release his tax returns and for his \u201cvulgar\u201d rhetoric. Conway currently serves as one of Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders and as his White House counselor. \n \n Even if Mulvaney had never uttered a critical word about Trump, the chances he would last long in a chief of staff post would have likely been slim regardless. Two knowledgeable sources told The Daily...\n\n\nArticle:  \u201cDo I like Donald Trump? No,\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said of President Donald Trump one week before the 2016 election. | Alex Wong/Getty Images White House Mulvaney called Trump a 'terrible human being' ahead of 2016 election \n \n Mick Mulvaney called then-candidate Donald Trump \u201ca terrible human being\u201d in a video from November 2016 that re-surfaced Friday, hours after the president named him as acting White House chief of staff. \n \n The remarks came one week before the presidential election during a debate between Mulvaney, then a Republican congressman from South Carolina, and his Democratic challenger at a middle school in York, South Carolina, according to The Daily Beast, which first published the footage. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Asked if he was supporting his party\u2019s candidate for the White House, Mulvaney replied: \u201cSure. If I have any chance to accomplish what the majority of the Fifth District of South Carolina sent me to Washington to do, Donald Trump has to be president. Period. That\u2019s it.\u201d \n \n Revising America\u2019s health care system, balancing the federal budget and other policy goals popular among his constituents could only be accomplished if former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was defeated on Election Day, Mulvaney argued. \n \n \u201cDo I like Donald Trump? No,\u201d Mulvaney said, insisting that the real estate mogul and reality TV showman was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a role model for his two sons. But Mulvaney also said that Clinton was not a role model for his daughter, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t like her very much, either.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe have perhaps two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cSo I have to step back and look and say, \u2018OK, what do y\u2019all, the majority of the folks who vote for me, want me to do?\u2019 In order to accomplish that, I have to support Donald Trump, and he has to win.\u201d \n \n Mulvaney warned that Clinton\u2019s election would not be an extension of her husband\u2019s time in office, but instead would amount to a third term for...\n", "completion": "If you've ever called your boss a \"terrible human being,\" it turns out you sort of have something in common with the president's next acting chief of staff. Mick Mulvaney, who was named as John Kelly's replacement on Friday, used those choice words in reference to Donald Trump one week before the 2016 election. Politico reports Mulvaney was up for re-election in the House (he won), and referred to Trump and Hillary Clinton during a South Carolina debate as \"perhaps two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country\" when asked whether he was throwing his support behind the GOP candidate. He zeroed in on Trump specifically, saying \"Do I like Donald Trump? No\" and noting he didn't see Trump as a role model for his sons. And there's this: \"Yes, I am supporting Donald Trump, but I\u2019m doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that I think he\u2019s a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.\" USA Today reports it was only hours after the Mulvaney news broke on Friday that the Daily Beast posted video of those comments. Mulvaney himself had more positive words on Friday, tweeting, \"This is a tremendous honor. I look forward to working with the President and the entire team. It\u2019s going to be a great 2019!\" (Mulvaney will hold onto his other jobs in the administration.)<|endoftext|>"}

Specifically, the North is warning of \"surgical strikes at any time\" and a \"precision nuclear striking tool\" that will seek to \"advance our long-cherished wish for national reunification,\" reports the AP.

Right now, sanctions include a ban on ballistic missile and nuclear tests and a ban on the import of arms and luxury goods; some in the country face financial and travel restrictions, and the new measures could expand them. China was expected, however, to refuse an oil embargo, believing that such a blow to the North Korean economy could bring refugees to China.

{"prompt": "What are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: In June in 1986, Hans Riegel told one of the jokes for which he had become well-known. The Haribo CEO told a reporter he had just swallowed Maoam. All Riegel had to do was wait a second for a question in response: \"The candy?\" \"No,\" he answered triumphantly. \"The company. It was a lot of fun -- they used to be a competitor.\" \n \n It would be hard to find another executive in Germany as multifaceted as the former head of Bonn-based gummy bear empire Haribo. Riegel was equal parts tenacious businessman, jokester, workaholic and bon vivant. Above all, he was the man associated with Haribo -- few entrepreneurs have been as closely identified with their brands as he has been. In his 67 years at the helm, he transformed his father's small candy company into a global sweets giant with an estimated \u00802 billion ($2.7 billion) in annual sales of gummy bears and other candies in 110 countries around the world. \n \n Riegel died on Tuesday at the age of 90. \n \n He was the archetype of the old-school German capitalist from the Rhineland -- hardworking, responsible, persistent and full of business acumen. After having just returned from being a prisoner of war after World War II, Riegel and his brother Paul assumed responsibility for the family business, which at the time had 30 employees, 10 sacks of sugar and the secret recipe for gummy bears that still guarantees the company's success today. Paul, who was more behind the scenes, developed the machines used to make the company's liquorices. The more outgoing Hans worked on the company's first commercials. \n \n The Man Who Turned Warren Buffet Away \n \n The division of labor between the two brothers was a success, and it didn't take long before the company's motto, \"Kids love it so,\" created by their father, was known by youth all across Germany.

The candy entrepreneur had an estimated net worth of nearly $3 billion when he died at the age of 90. He was divorced and had no children. \n \n Riegel\u2019s father -- Hans Riegel Sr. -- founded the confectionery company in Bonn, Germany, in 1920, and soon after created the chewy, fruit-flavored bear candies that eventually became a household name worldwide. He died in 1945. After being released from POW camps post-World War II, the younger Hans Riegel and his brother Paul took over Haribo, dividing the labor with Hans handling distribution, sales and marketing and Paul handling production. The set-up proved successful and continued thereafter, helping the two brothers build Haribo into the multi-billion dollar global empire it is today. Haribo is notoriously tight-lipped, but estimated revenues exceed $3 billion. Among Haribo\u2019s current top sellers are the gummi bears, Happy Cola, twin cherries and raspberries. \n \n \"We all mourn a unique entrepreneur and as an outstanding personality will remain many people as a friend and supporter, as a mentor, and last but not least as inspiring role model in memory,\" the company said in a statement. \"With his pioneering spirit, he has created a worldwide unparalleled company and a brand which fame and popularity is second to none.\" \n \n Riegel is credited with inventing more than 200 sweets, including Vademecum sugar-free gum and Maoam fruit chewies, and has said he gets his inspiration from reading comic books and watching movies for children.

Almost 700,000 Syrians have been registered as refugees in the country, which has a population of just 6.5 million. Those are just the ones who have registered; Jordanian officials say the real number is far over 1 million. \n \n But Jordan's hospitality may have hit a limit. \n \n In the past year, as the trickle of new refugees entering the country slowed to a crawl, thousands of Syrian refugees have become trapped in an isolated no man's land between Syria and Jordan known as \"the berm.\" Current estimates suggest more than 75,000 people are stuck in this area, but Jordanian authorities refused to allow access to the site for journalists and only limited access for aid groups. \n \n A report from Amnesty International published Wednesday evening shows just how dire the situation on the berm has become. Using information from satellite images, video footage and a number of first-person accounts, Amnesty was able to show not only a dramatic growth in the size of the settlement at the border, but also what may be evidence of death and disease at the site. \n \n The satellite imagery appears to show a dramatic growth in shelters at Rukban, one of two border crossings between Syria and Jordan, over the past year.

But government spokesman Mohammad Momani told the Jordan Times on Sunday that while the borders remain sealed, a new method of delivery will be used: cranes that will lower the goods from the northeastern side of the border to the other side (there was a one-off delivery like this in August). And it sounds like the aid is coming just in time. Per the AP, the refugees are living in tents and suffering not only from hunger and exposure to the elements, but also from serious illness, including whooping cough and hepatitis. Last month, Amnesty International released chilling video footage and satellite images that showed graves and burial mounds in the berm, per the Washington Post. \"Many people have died,\" a refugee living in one of the camps told the group, saying conditions were \"awful.\" \"The mood among the people \u2026 is below zero.\" Two anonymous aid officials tell the news agency there's been no final confirmation, but Momani says the plans are being put in place to expedite the deliveries. \"The aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,\" he says, noting the aid groups will make the call on the pace of the deliveries.

Millions know the name Dylann Storm Roof.

Members both celebrated Woodward as a \"one man gay Jew wrecking crew\" and raged that one of their own may have leaked Woodward's AWD affiliation.

On the morning of September 12, a sea of empty white gurneys sparkled in front of Manhattan\u2019s St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital. The building was already papered with pictures of people who had vanished forever. In Boston this week, the aftermath of violence looked different. Only three people died within 24 hours of the blast on Boylston Street. But like the improvised bombings that plague Iraq and Afghanistan, the attack left scores of civilians mortally injured, many with lower limbs hanging by threads. The incident may be remembered less for the deaths it caused than for the flesh and bone it ravaged. \n \n But the Patriots\u2019 Day bombing reveals the tremendous strides that emergency physicians have made in the past decade. The assault occurred within blocks of what President Obama called \u201csome of the best hospitals in the world.\u201d A medical team was already working the finish line when the shrapnel started flying. And thanks to this country\u2019s recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, physicians and emergency workers almost surely saved patients who would have died from the same injuries a decade ago. \n \n For all their failings, America\u2019s recent foreign wars have driven medical breakthroughs that are now saving civilians at home. \n \n It\u2019s hardly the first time this has happened. The need to keep wounded fighters alive has long been an engine of medical progress. Roughly one soldier died for every 1.7 injured in World War II. In Iraq and Afghanistan, one died for every seven wounded\u2014a decline of more than 75%. The advances fueling that progress span fields as diverse as orthopedics, pharmacology and bandage design, and most are now common in civilian medicine. \n \n Some of the breakthroughs have been astonishingly low-tech. Take the tourniquet, for instance, a device that dates back at least to the second century BC. Blood loss is the leading cause of death among trauma victims. A tourniquet...\n\n\nArticle:  O \n \n n Monday, two bombs ripped through crowds packed in to watch the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring at least 170 others. \n \n Fortunately for victims of the attacks, Boston and the surrounding metro area are home to a number of medical facilities, including some of the nation's top hospitals \u2014 and doctors. Perhaps more so than most cities, Boston had the resources on hand to deftly handle a crisis of that magnitude. \n \n With nearly 80 hospitals and a bevy of medical schools, the city has an expansive medical network that can absorb a heavy influx of patients, ensuring that patients receive treatment as quickly as possible. According to The Boston Globe, eight area hospitals had treated nearly 150 patients as of Tuesday afternoon. Massachusetts General, Boston Medical Center, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Tufts Medical Center, and Beth Israel \u00adDeaconess all treated more than a dozen patients each. Boston Children's Hospital treated an additional eight patients. \n \n On scene, the wave of first responders converted a medical tent into a makeshift infirmary, treating victims and stabilizing those with more serious injuries before sending them off to the various hospitals. Those first responders reportedly included some doctors racing in the marathon who stopped to tend to victims on site. As the injury tally mounted, off-duty doctors rushed in to help; an additional 100 medical personnel headed to Beth Israel alone. \n \n That's all on top of the already-increased staff levels at area hospitals, which typically add more shifts to handle common race injuries on Marathon Monday. \n \n \"I've never been prouder to work here,\" Dr. Andrew Ulrich, executive vice chairman of Boston Medical Center's Department of Emergency Medicine, told the Boston Herald. \"The staff response was outstanding.\" \n \n As a medical hub, Boston's hospitals are renowned as being among the country's best.

And it was almost like you could hear each other breathing. And everybody looked at me and said, 'Is this another one of your crazy drills?' and the first thing I said was, 'No, this is not a drill. This is for real. We need to huddle up.' \" \n \n At first they thought it was something accidental, like a manhole cover explosion. \n \n \"But once we actually found out that this was a man-made event, there's a certain mental toll that sort of hits a switch in some of the staff. And they say, 'Why would somebody do this?' \" Osgood said. \n \n But soon there was no time for such thoughts. Terribly injured patients began coming through the emergency room doors of every big hospital in the city. \n \n 'A Lot Of Very Horrific Injuries' \n \n Across town at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, emergency room specialist Dr. Stephen Epstein described the carnage: \n \n \"Limbs that were severed, limbs that, you know, we hope we can save, and some that we might not be able to save.

What about this one? \n \n \u201cAs an orthopedic surgeon, we see patients like this, with mangled extremities, but we don\u2019t see 16 of them at the same time, and we don\u2019t see patients from blast injuries,\u201d Dr. Peter Burke, the trauma surgery chief at Boston Medical Center, said. \n \n The toll from the bombs Monday at the Boston Marathon, which killed at least three and injured more than 170, will long be felt by anyone involved with the city\u2019s iconic sporting event. For the victims, the physical legacy could be an especially cruel one for a group that was involved in the marathon: severe leg trauma and amputations. \n \n \u201cWhat we like to do is before we take off someone\u2019s leg \u2014 it\u2019s extremely hard to make that decision \u2014 is we often get two surgeons to agree,\u201d Dr. Tracey Dechert, a trauma surgeon at Boston Medical, said. \u201cAm I right here? This can\u2019t be saved. So that way you feel better and know that you didn\u2019t take off someone\u2019s leg that you didn\u2019t have to take.

Ki'ari underwent emergency surgery to clear scar tissue on her windpipe so she could breathe; after the tracheotomy, she continued to have difficulty breathing (requiring two trips to the ER) and also talking. She had a doctor's appointment set for Friday to be checked. But on Sunday night, she told her mother's boyfriend she was struggling to breathe; she lost consciousness within minutes and was pronounced dead about an hour later, at 12:15am Monday, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The Medical Examiner's Office is still determining Ki'ari's cause of death, and Florida's Department of Children and Families is investigating the incident. There have been at least 10 other DCF cases related to the family since 2008, the Palm Beach Post reports, five of them involving alleged domestic violence between Ki'ari's mother and her boyfriend; it's not clear whether the boyfriend who called 911 after Ki'ari lost consciousness is the same one from those reports. At least one of the DCF cases resulted in verified proof of abuse or neglect, but details aren't available. DCF isn't saying whether the girl's mother or other family members are under investigation, but a woman identifying herself as the mother's cousin says DCF officials took Ki'ari's three siblings away Thursday.

She lived in the United States illegally for years, receiving public assistance in Boston.Aunt Zeituni, as she has come to be known, first surfaced in the public light in 2008, in the final days of the Presidential election. Then-candidate Obama said that he was not against the possible deportation of his aunt. \"If she has violated laws, then those laws have to be obeyed,\" he told CBS's Katie Couric. \"We are a nation of laws.\"Onyango had violated the law, and she knew it.\"I knew I had overstayed\" she told WBZ-TV's Jonathan Elias when the two sat down one-on-one.Zeituni Onyango said she came to the United States in 2000 and had every intention of leaving. Then, however, she says she got deathly ill and was hospitalized. When she recovered, she said she was broke and couldn't afford to leave.For two years Onyango said she lived in a homeless shelter, before she was assigned public housing despite thousands of legal residents also awaiting assistance. \"I didn't take any advantage of the system. The system took advantage of me.\"\"I didn't ask for it; they gave it to me. Ask your system. I didn't create it or vote for it. Go and ask your system,\" she said unapologetically.And she's right.

Gaugler/Science Source \n \n For the first time in decades, researchers trying to develop a vaccine for malaria have discovered a new target they can use to attack this deadly and common parasite. \n \n Finding a target for attack is a far cry from having a vaccine. And the history of malaria vaccines is littered with hopeful ideas that didn't pan out. Still, researchers in the field welcome this fresh approach. \n \n Over the past four decades, researchers have developed about 100 potential vaccines for malaria. The best of the bunch is still only modestly successful in children, who are at greatest risk for the disease. The mosquito-borne parasite kills more than 600,000 children a year, mostly in Africa. \n \n So Dr. Jonathan Kurtis, at the Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University, decided it was time for a fresh start. He had developed a severe case of malaria while he was an undergraduate studying abroad in Kenya. And he learned just how devastating this disease can be, not only killing young children but causing hundreds of millions of cases of debilitating illness every year. \n \n Kurtis and his colleagues started with samples of blood that had been methodically collected from children in Tanzania by Drs. Michal Fried and Patrick Duffy at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kurtis' team carefully examined those samples to find small but crucial differences between children who got infected but didn't fall seriously ill and children who developed a severe case of the disease. \n \n \"We're finding the rare needle in a haystack,\" Kurtis says. \"We're finding the rare parasite protein that generates a protective immune response.\" \n \n Earlier vaccine efforts have produced antibodies that target proteins on the malaria parasite that it uses to break into red blood cells \u2014 the parasite reproduces inside those cells. But the particular parasite protein that Kurtis isolated from the blood of these...\n", "completion": "Researchers think they've found a promising new potential weapon in the fight against malaria in a fairly unlikely place: the blood of toddlers. In a paper published in Science today, researchers detail how they examined the blood of more than 750 children in Tanzania. They found that about 6% of those children had an antibody against one of the disease's key proteins, and that those children didn't suffer from severe malaria. Researchers think they can make a vaccine patterned on their blood, Paul Rodgers at Forbes explains. Until now, most malaria vaccines have focused on keeping the disease out of the red blood cells it reproduces in. But this antibody is unique in that it instead attacks the protein that allows the parasite to escape the cells. \"We're sort of trapping the parasite in the burning house,\" says co-lead author Jonathan Kurtis\u2014who suffered his own bout of malaria while studying in Kenya while in college, NPR reports. The team believes this approach could work in concert with existing vaccines. It's a refreshing, promising idea, one Harvard doctor says, though she cautions that \"this is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans.\" It's been trialed in mice and will soon be tested on monkeys.<|endoftext|>"}

Authorities shifted a focus of their......\n\n\nArticle:  Surely, though, the chances of escape must improve over time? Perhaps: The longer fugitives are out of hand, the farther away they can get, the better they disguise themselves, and the less the media covers them, decreasing the chance a vigilant citizen will spot and report them. (Many of the U.S. Marshals\u2019 15 most wanted have been on the lam for a very long time, such as Raymond Abbott-Baerga , who escaped a maximum-security prison, amid a hail of gunfire, in 1992.) \n \n As with so many criminal-justice issues in the news this year , there aren\u2019t reliable, comprehensive statistics on prison escapes. But Richard Culp , a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, surveyed the available data in 2005 and came up with some useful context. Combing various calculations and data sets, Culp calculated that about three-quarters of all escaped inmates were recaptured . Break those numbers out and the figures get even less favorable for Matt and Sweat: More than 92 percent of fugitives from medium- and high-security prisons were captured within a year (compared to less than 70 percent of work-release escapees). And that estimate is conservative. \n \n Monday\u2019s discovery of DNA belonging to both men in a cabin only about 25 miles from the prison\u2014DNA seemingly just a few days old\u2014suggests that police may be getting closer to them. That\u2019s very different from having the two men in hand. But statistics on prison escapees suggest that Sweat and Matt will have a very hard time avoiding recapture\u2014though if they make it past the first month, their odds seem to improve. \n \n For days after Richard Matt and David Sweat\u2019s June 6 escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, there seemed to be little concrete evidence of where they were. Reports had them heading toward Vermont or perhaps Canada. Then they were thought to be near the Pennsylvania border. As hundreds of law enforcement officers combed through roads and fields and forests, Matt and Sweat stayed out of sight. \n \n In a separate 2005...\n", "completion": "If New York investigators are right, Richard Matt and David Sweat are probably sleeping right now\u2014but they'll wake soon and continue picking their way through the woods and back roads toward Canada when darkness falls. At an update today on the hunt for the prison escapees, authorities say they're now pretty sure the men are trying to make the border, reports NBC News. \"Based on what we know at this point, we have a high degree of confidence in our conclusion,\" says Maj. Charles Guess of the state police. Guess didn't provide specifics, but he said investigators found \"significant\" items from the men in a cabin and in a field in the town of Malone yesterday and this morning, reports AP. They've shifted their search accordingly in a bid to head the men off. Matt and Sweat have eluded capture for three weeks now, which is impressive, but it doesn't protect them from this damning stat cited by the Atlantic: More than 92% of escapees from medium- and high-security prisons are caught within a year. Their odds improve somewhat if they make it past a month, however. The search update comes after a second prison worker was charged in the escape. (He once likened the inmates at his prison in Dannemora to caged \"puppies.\")<|endoftext|>"}

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) is seeking input on a bill that would impose a two-year ban on new laws or regulations that affect the Internet. \n \n Issa released a draft of his Internet American Moratorium Act on Monday night and said that he would answer questions about the legislation on Reddit, a social news and discussion site, on Wednesday morning. \n \n The one-page draft bill would prohibit Congress and all regulatory agencies from enacting rules that affect the Internet for two years, with an exception for national security emergencies. \n \n \n \n Many Reddit users are fierce defenders of Internet freedom, and the site helped organize opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) earlier this year. Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was one of the leading opponents of the controversial anti-piracy legislation. \n \n But Gigi Sohn, president of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, explained that Issa's bill would not actually prevent Congress from passing laws like SOPA. \n \n \"Even if they pass this bill, Congress could pass another Internet regulation bill that would supersede the previous bill,\" Sohn said. \n \n Issa's bill would, however, prevent regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), from adopting new rules that affect the Internet. \n \n Sohn warned that prohibiting all government regulation of the Internet would \"throw the Internet into corporate hands.\" \n \n Most Democrats support the FCC's net neutrality rules, which prohibit Internet service providers from slowing down or blocking legitimate websites. Supporters say the rules are critical for ensuring an open and free Internet. \n \n But Issa and other Republicans argue that net neutrality is an unnecessary burden on businesses. \n \n Sohn noted that Issa's bill wouldn't stop the net neutrality rules since the FCC already enacted them, but the bill could block other potential regulations, such as rules on broadband caps. \n \n The FCC isn't...\n\n\nArticle:  Story highlights Rep.

The bill would \"create a two-year moratorium on any new laws, rules or regulations governing the Internet.\" \n \n \"Together, we can make Washington take a break from messing w/ the Internet,\" Issa said on Reddit, where he also invited users to suggest changes to the proposed bill.

With the first phase of the operation completed, the second phase began on 27 May.

Though Keys says she'll be working closely with BlackBerry developers and is \"fascinated by technology,\" her role is more similar to that of another celebrity: Will.i.am, who was previously named Director of Creative Innovation of Intel. All in all, it's quite the turnaround from calling herself an \"iPhone junky\" last year \u2014 how the heart does wander. \n \n BlackBerry is also trying to pull in some other big names: Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez (referred to as the \"world's most inspirational people\") will be using the platform for a film and art/storytelling project, respectively. We're not quite sure yet what that will mean in practice \u2014 though BlackBerry's been pushing its typing chops pretty hard, so making somebody write a novel on their phone isn't out of the question. Keys, meanwhile, will be taking the BlackBerry on tour and will use it to create a music video for every city she visits.

Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the \"heartfelt and brutal honesty\" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes. It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the Q10 was created for customers \"that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience,\" reports USA Today. The company also added some star power, announcing that Alicia Keys would be its new Global Creative director, a position created for her, the Verge reports. The company also boasted that Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project. On to the features. First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft's latest Windows iteration. BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry's dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile. As for hardware, BlackBerry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier.

CBS Philly reports that administrators shut off Butera's microphone after he veered off his pre-approved script to condemn what he called the \"authoritative attitude\" of some of the school's faculty and staff, an attitude, he said, that \"prevents students from developing as true leaders. Hopefully, this will change.\" At which point his mic went silent. The Wilkes-Barre Citizens' Voice quotes a statement from principal Jon Pollard in which he explains he felt obligated to stop Butera's speech in order to \"ensure the remainder of [it] was not demeaning or derogatory to his classmates, the underclassmen, faculty, staff or administration.\" The Washington Post talks to a friend of Butera's who says Butera was frustrated by having numerous ideas turned down by Pollard during his four years as class president.

An unnamed industry source reportedly told the Korean publication that Apple has chosen the larger display and has already begun ordering the part from suppliers.The rumor suggested that domestic Korean suppliers have received the orders, making Samsung and LG likely candidates as suppliers. Both companies have supplied displays for Apple's mobile products in the past.The original report also claimed that the new display would be a Retina Display, which Apple specifies as having a pixel density of 300 pixels per inch when used at a distance of 10-12 inches.If accurate, Wednesday's report signals a break by Apple from its past practice, as the company has elected not to change the 3.5-inch screen size of the iPhone since it launched in 2007. However, the likelihood that the rumor is indeed accurate appears to be relatively low. Rumors of a 4-inch iPhone screen have persisted for some time now, but claims of a 4.6-inch screen size are some of the largest yet.In addition, the rumored second quarter launch is highly questionable, as it would mean a new iPhone arriving between six to nine months after the iPhone 4S.

While Apple started the trend of smartphones with large touchscreens, its 3.5-inch screen has started to look diminutive next to offerings like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus' 4.65 inches. But MacRumors is dubious about the report, noting that numerous previous whispers put the new screen at 4 inches, and that many companies making iPhone cases seem to be betting on that.

Our secondary objectives included investigating whether loneliness or social isolation was differentially associated with incident heart disease and stroke, and whether the association between social relationships and disease incidence varied according to age, gender, marital status, socioeconomic position, ethnicity and health. \n \n Researchers have identified three main pathways through which social relationships may affect health: behavioural, psychological and physiological mechanisms. 3 , 4 Health-risk behaviours associated with loneliness and social isolation include physical inactivity and smoking. 5 Loneliness is linked to lower self-esteem and limited use of active coping methods, 6 while social isolation predicts decline in self-efficacy. 7 Feeling lonely or being socially isolated is associated with defective immune functioning and higher blood pressure. 8 , 9 This evidence suggests that loneliness and social isolation may be important risk factors for developing disease, and that addressing them would benefit public health and well-being. \n \n Adults who have few social contacts (ie, who are socially isolated) or feel unhappy about their social relationships (ie, who are lonely) are at increased risk of premature mortality. 1 The influence of social relationships on mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors, including physical activity and obesity. 2 Yet, compared with our understanding of these risk factors, we know much less about the implications of loneliness and social isolation for disease aetiology. \n \n Finally, sensitivity analyses were performed to test...\n\n\nArticle:  Photo \n \n Loneliness may make you sick. \n \n Researchers, writing in the journal Heart, pooled data from 23 studies and found that social isolation or feelings of loneliness were tied to an increased risk for coronary heart disease and stroke. \n \n The studies included data from 181,006 men and women 18 and older. There were 4,628 coronary events and 3,002 strokes in follow-up periods ranging from three to 21 years. Three of the papers measured loneliness, 18 looked at social isolation and two included both. Social isolation and loneliness were determined with questionnaires; the researchers depended on medical records and death certificates for determining coronary events and stroke. \n \n The scientists found that loneliness and social isolation increased the relative risk of having a heart attack, angina or a death from heart disease by 29 percent, and the risk of stroke by 32 percent. There were no differences between men and women. \n \n \u201cPeople have tended to focus from a policy point of view at targeting lonely people to make them more connected,\u201d said the lead author, Nicole K.

In 2006, a JAMA study found social isolation in childhood may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in adulthood. A couple years later, at Ohio State University, researchers found that social isolation, in mice anyway, makes strokes more deadly. The team conducted a second study in 2010 and found having no contact with friends or family can worsen the brain damages caused by a heart attack. Then, in 2015, Brigham Young University put it plainly: The prescription for living longer is to spend less time alone. \n \n While experts have started to suspect loneliness negatively affects heart health, new research published today in the journal Heart argues that the topic has yet to be widely studied. Study co-author Nicole Valtorta, research fellow at the University of York, told Medical Daily that the existing literature her team reviewed focused more on how weakened social relationships increase risk for mortality overall. \u201cIt didn\u2019t tell us if people who felt lonely were at increased risk of developing disease once they were in ill health,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to bring together the information of all the studies we could find and see what comes of it.\u201d \n \n Valtorta and her colleagues at York and the universities of Liverpool and Newcastle combed through 1 6 research databases for studies that investigated new cases of heart disease and stroke at the individual level as a function of loneliness, social isolation, or both.

Medication provided to the child before the transplant may have prevented HIV transmission, though that will only become clear over time, they said. A liver from a donor without HIV was not available in a country where there is a chronic shortage of organs available for transplant. \n \n \"The transplant team faced the dilemma of saving the child's life whilst at the same time knowing that the child might end up HIV-positive because of this decision,\" the university said. \n \n The mother, who was taking antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV, had asked if she could donate part of her liver to save her child's life, and the medical team explained the risks of \"living liver donation\" to her, according to the university.

This means that doctors struggle to find suitable donor organs for critically ill patients who would die without receiving a transplant. Sometimes they have to make tough calls such as using a blood group incompatible organ to save a patient\u2019s life \u2013 even if this comes with additional risk. \n \n About a year ago we made a tough call of our own: we could save a child\u2019s life by giving the child a liver transplant \u2013 but risked infecting the child with HIV in the process. The donor was the child\u2019s mother, who is HIV positive and the child was HIV negative. The procedure came with a risk of transmitting HIV to the child. \n \n South Africa\u2019s law does not forbid the transplantation of an organ from a living HIV positive donor to an HIV negative recipient, provided that a robust informed consent process is in place. But this isn\u2019t universally accepted as best clinical practice because of the risk of HIV transmission to the recipient. \n \n The young recipient had been on the organ donor waiting list for 181 days. The average time on the waiting list in our transplant programme is 49 days. The child\u2019s mother had repeatedly asked if she could donate a part of her liver, but we could not consider this because it was against the policy in our unit at the time. Without a transplant, the child would certainly have died. \n \n After much consideration, and with permission from the Medical Ethics Committee at Johannesburg\u2019s University of the Witwatersrand, we decided to go ahead with the transplant. With careful planning we were able to give the child antiretroviral drugs in advance, with the hope of preventing HIV infection. \n \n The transplant, which happened at the University of the Witwatersrand\u2019s Donald Gordon Medical Centre, was a success.

Finally, surgeons at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre decided they had no choice and performed what is believed to be the world's first transplant from an HIV-positive donor, per a university release. The surgery itself went well, and, more significantly, the child is HIV negative one year later. It's too early to say whether that will hold true permanently, but the news is being hailed as a potentially big development, especially in countries such as South Africa where HIV is prevalent. \"This operation could be a game changer for South Africa,\" write three officials from the University of Witwatersrand (affiliated with the hospital) in the Conversation. \"The country has a large pool of virally suppressed HIV-positive people who have previously not been considered for living liver donation.\" The piece details the ethical quandaries the hospital faced, including whether it would be right to deny the mother a chance to save her baby, even with the risk of HIV infection. The story is drawing international attention, and in the US, Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health says doctors made the right choice\u2014even if the child had emerged with HIV. \"If it is a choice between death and living reasonably well with a treatable infection, I think they made a quite reasonable choice,\" he tells the AP.

The Passaic store owner ran Quezada's ticket through the lottery machine to validate that it was a winner as a newspaper and television outlets recorded the moment. \n \n The New Jersey Lottery confirmed that the winning ticket was validated at the store at 4:30 p.m. Monday, but officials said they didn't yet know the winner's name. \n \n Quezada told reporters in Spanish that he was \"very happy\" and that he intends to help his family. \n \n His wife, Ines Sanchez, told the Bergen Record that Quezada called her with the news Monday afternoon. \n \n \"I still can't believe it,\" she said. \"We never expected it but thank God.\" \n \n The numbers drawn Saturday were 17, 29, 31, 52, 53 and Powerball 31.

It's the fourth-largest jackpot in Powerball history. \n \n The family's apartment sits at the end of a short dead end block that abuts a highway in Passaic, 15 miles northwest of New York City. Neighbors stood out in the rain Monday night and spoke with pride that one of their own had struck it rich. \n \n Eladia Vazquez has lived across the street from Quezada's building for the past 25 years. The block has a half-dozen three-story brick apartment buildings on each side, and Vazquez says it's a neighborhood where everyone knows everyone, including what car they drive and what parking space they use. \n \n Vazquez described Quezada and his wife as \"quiet and not overly talkative\" but sensed that they seemed to be working all the time. \n \n \"This is super for all of us on this block,\" she said. \"They...\n", "completion": "Bodega owner Pedro Quezada has seen his share of hard times. The 44-year-old father of five lives with his wife and kids in Passaic, one of the poorest areas of North Jersey; years ago, a fire destroyed much of their store, and just one year later, thieves stole everything they could from the family's apartment. But now, finally, Quezada's luck has changed: On Saturday, as he did every night, he bought a Powerball ticket from Eagle Liquors\u2014but this time, his was the winning ticket. He returned to Eagle Liquors last night to reveal himself to his excited neighbors as the winner of the $338 million jackpot. With the lump sum payment, he'll take home about $152 million after taxes, the Record reports. He also broke the news to his family: He called them only after signing the ticket, telling his wife, \"I'm a millionaire, Ines. Did you hear?\" Neighbors described the couple as quiet but hard-working, and expressed happiness at their good fortune. \"I'm just glad it went to somebody that could use it,\" says one. Another calls the win \"a blessing for the neighborhood,\" because \"it gives people hope that there is a blessing somewhere, for somebody.\" As for what Quezada will do with the money, he says, \"I want to help a lot of people, in whatever they need, in rent, in whatever.\" First, he'll help his family, the AP reports. In Spanish, he told reporters that he's \"very happy.\"<|endoftext|>"}

The study was published today (March 10) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n \"Volcanoes are generally seen as these big, explosive destroyers of life, but they might be important in promoting biodiversity,\" said Ceridwen Fraser, a biogeographer at Australian National University in Canberra and lead study author. \"This explains how life survived in Antarctica, but we think this idea of geothermal refuges could also apply elsewhere.\" \n \n Frozen in place \n \n Today, mosses, lichens and small invertebrates thrive along Antarctica's coast.

Currently, nudism in Paris is punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $16,800, reports France24. It notes a single swimming pool in the city allows naked swimming, but even then, only after 9pm on certain days of the week. Opponents worry about inflaming tensions between conservative and liberal groups, particularly on the heels of the burkini brouhaha. Despite those objections, the BBC suggests the zone could be in place as early as next summer.<|endoftext|>"}

Yet Mercer's money is sure making a lot of noise on the campaign trail. \n \n The third most generous Republican donor this cycle, Mercer has cut checks for a total of $37 million in the past six years, supporting pro-life candidates, those who deny man-made global warming, as well as helping fund the effort to block construction of a mosque near the site of the September 11 attacks in New York. In fact, this year he gave more to the Koch brothers' organization, $2.5 million, than the Kansas founders, David and Charles, who each chipped in just $2 million to Freedom Partners Action Fund. \n \n Bloomberg Visual Data \n \n Yet the man who first made his mark by upending the field of computer linguistics and is now seeking to bend the national political debate in his conservative direction, is a stranger to the electorate he seeks to sway and the public that would be affected should he succeed.

It's easy to understand, gets real intense, and the commentary adds a ton to the proceedings. \n \n But this year had an extra element of spice, after 16-year-old Joseph Saelee obliterated a seven-time world champion to become the king of Tetris. \n \n The Tetris championships are full of familiar faceds, with people who have been playing for aeons. Saelee, on the other hand, had to qualify for the finals. But qualify he did, coming into the final bracket as the fifth seed - not a bad effort for his first finals appearance. \n \n Saelee nearly didn't make it to the finals, having found himself on the ropes in the semi-finals against Japanese grand master Koryan. The intensity is fascinating, as players make split-second decisions on whether to continue building their playfield versus clearing lines faster. \n \n The Tetris World Championships is almost like watching a fighting game. The commentary has a similar beat and pace, there's constant planning ahead as players calculate their playfield ahead of time. You've also got RNG, dealing with the prospect of never getting those crucial long pieces that are necessary for a full Tetris (clearing four lines at once). \n \n What's worth keeping in mind is that these players are using the traditional NES pads, which can't be comfortable if you're tapping the D-pad constantly (as Joseph does with the \"hypertapping\" technique). \n \n And there was plenty of history. The other finalist was Jonas Neubauer, a seven-time Tetris champion and the current world champion three times running. It was a story straight out of a shonen anime: the new up and comer and the king at the top of the summit, looking down below at the competition. \n \n The second and third game of the series also went completely to the wire.

Eight Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC) tournaments have been held since the competition\u2019s inception in 2010. Neubauer has won seven of them. \n \n \n \n On one hand, Neubauer is just a normal guy who works at a bar, drinks a lot of coffee, and plays video games in his downtime.

But that does not mean everyone who signs up for insurance can enroll in a health plan. \n \n The problem is that the systems that are supposed to deliver consumer information to insurers still have not been fixed.

Some insurers say they have been deluged with phone calls from people who believe they have signed up for a particular health plan, only to find that the company has no record of the enrollment. Others say information they received about new enrollees was inaccurate or incomplete, so they had to track down additional data \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a laborious task that will not be feasible if data is missing for tens of thousands of consumers. \n \n In still other cases, insurers said, they have not been told how much of a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premium will be subsidized by the government, so they do not know how much to charge the policyholder. \n \n In trying to fix HealthCare.gov, President Obama has given top priority to the needs of consumers, assuming that arrangements with insurers can be worked out later. \n \n The White House announced on Sunday that it had met its goal for improving HealthCare.gov so the website \u00e2\u20ac\u015bwill work smoothly for the vast majority of users.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 \n \n In effect, the administration gave itself a passing grade.

People have been calling insurers thinking they've signed up for a plan, but insurers have been missing some information\u2014or lack any record of the transaction, the New York Times reports. Although insurers \"don\u2019t have the responsibility or the capability to fix the system, they\u2019re reliant on it,\" says one consultant. \"Somehow people are getting lost in the process,\" says one exec. \"If they go to a doctor or a hospital and we have no record of them, that will be very upsetting to consumers.\" Sometimes, it remains unclear how much coverage the government is paying for, and insurers are concerned about late payments from the government. Some insurers and states are pushing for a way to leapfrog the federal site, the Wall Street Journal reports.

So is it one? Critics are split. The action sequences, complete with \"futuristic CGI flying machines\" are impressive, but it's \"Blomkamp's critique of a society riven by class and racial differences\" that sets it apart, Soren Anderson writes for the Seattle Times. \"Few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as Blomkamp does here.\" But at the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan's high hopes were dashed. \"Elysium is no promised land.\" Though Matt Damon is great as always and the visuals are equally as impressive, \"the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped.\" District 9 did a much better job of connecting genre (sci-fi) and theme (\"socio-political concerns\"). Even with the talented Damon along for the ride, Dana Stephens at Slate writes Elysium \"does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot ...

{"prompt": "What are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: The sound of an actual ticking clock can speed up women\u2019s attitudes on reproductive timing \n \n New York | Heidelberg, 13 August 2014 \n \n The metaphor of a ticking clock is often used to refer to a woman\u2019s growing urge \u2013 from puberty onwards to menopause \u2013 to conceive before her childbearing years are over. New research in Springer\u2019s journal Human Nature shows that there\u2019s more truth to this phrase than you might think. The subtle sound of a ticking clock can quite literally speed up a woman\u2019s reproductive timing. That is, the sound of a ticking clock can lead women to want to start a family at an earlier age, especially if she was raised in a lower socio-economic community. This is according to Justin Moss and Jon Maner of Florida State University in the US. \n \n Reproductive timing refers to the time frame and the specific years during which people begin to focus their energy and resources towards bearing and caring for their offspring. Some researchers reason that when and how this happens is greatly influenced by a person\u2019s childhood years, his or her socio-economic background, and other subtle environmental factors. \n \n Moss and Maner completed two experiments to test the influence of a subtle environmental factor \u2013 the ticking of a small white kitchen clock \u2013 on people\u2019s reproductive timing attitudes. In the first, 59 men and women were asked questions about the age at which they\u2019d like to marry and start a family. It assessed how socio-economic background might influence some people to press the snooze button of their biological clocks, or begin to act. In the second experiment, the researchers examined to what extent 74 participants would alter the characteristics they normally sought in potential mates to possibly settle for less just in order to have children sooner. \n \n Their findings suggest that priming the idea of the passage of time through the sound of a ticking clock can influence various aspects of women\u2019s reproductive timing. The effect was especially noticeable among women who grew up in...\n\n\nArticle:  There\u2019s a category of social-science experiment where the only reasonable response is \u201cHuh, that\u2019s weird.\u201d The latest such experiment comes from the journal Human Nature, and it involves that least fun of subjects: biological clocks. Researchers interviewed a bunch of men and women about the age at which they\u2019d like to start a family, as well as what qualities mattered in a partner. In some of the interviews, there was a clock ticking audibly nearby. In others, no clock. \n \n The results: \n \n Their findings suggest that priming the idea of the passage of time through the sound of a ticking clock can influence various aspects of women\u2019s reproductive timing. The effect was especially noticeable among women who grew up in lower socio-economic communities. They wanted to get married and have their first child at a younger age than women with more resources. They also lowered the priority that they placed on men\u2019s social status and long-term earning potential. However, the effect of the clock did not do the same for men. The researchers were not surprised by this because men are able to father children well into their old age. Their reproductive lives are therefore not as limited as that of women. \n \n It\u2019s unclear what to take away from this experiment. There\u2019s obviously a difference between women\u2019s real-life reproductive decisions and what they say about their plans in the context of an experiment at a particular moment in time. Plus, we\u2019ve known for a while that all sorts of subtle cues can affect how people answer questions, whether for an experiment or a poll. \n \n Still: kinda weird.

Researchers asked men and women questions about their reproductive attitudes\u2014things like when they'd like to marry and have kids and how much they'd be willing to alter their \"requirements\" for a mate in order to start a family earlier\u2014and they found that the sound of a ticking clock influenced women's answers, possibly because it made them think about the passage of time. \"The very subtle sound prime of a ticking clock changed the timing with which women sought to have children and the traits they sought in potential partners\u2014both central aspects of women\u2019s mating-related psychology,\" says one of the lead researchers. Women who grew up in lower socioeconomic areas were particularly affected, wanting to get married and start families even earlier\u2014and placing a lower priority on their mate's status and earning potential\u2014than women who were raised with more resources. Not surprisingly, men, who can typically father children well into their later years, were not affected by the clock sound.

Fox News did not publicly announce the contract termination, and Carlson said on her Twitter account at the time that she was on \u201con vacation\u201d. \n \n \"I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career,\u201d Carlson said in a statement. \u201cAlthough this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace. I am extremely proud of my accomplishments at Fox News and for keeping our loyal viewers engaged and informed on events and news topics of the day.\u201d \n \n A spokesperson for 21st Century Fox released the following statement Wednesday afternoon: \n \n \"The Company has seen the allegations against Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy. We take these matters seriously. While we have full confidence in Mr. Ailes and Mr. Doocy, who have served the company brilliantly for over two decades, we have commenced an internal review of the matter.\" \n \n Ailes released a statement Wednesday calling the lawsuit \"defamatory\" and \"retaliatory.\" \n \n \u201cGretchen Carlson\u2019s allegations are false. This is a retaliatory suit for the network\u2019s decision not to...\n", "completion": "Gretchen Carlson made waves last month when she voiced approval for an assault weapons ban, but that was nothing compared to the bomb she dropped Wednesday: that she's no longer employed by Fox News and she's filing a sexual harassment and wrongful termination suit against her former boss, Roger Ailes, Politico reports. \"As you may have heard, I'm no longer with @FoxNews. I value your support and friendship so please stay in touch,\" the now-former host of The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson tweeted Wednesday, adding links to her social media pages and website. The news about her suit was emailed to reporters from the law firm representing her, noting her contract had been terminated June 23, even though Fox never announced it; Carlson's own tweets from last month suggested she was simply on vacation. The complaint alleges Ailes made \"sexually-charged comments [to Carlson], ranging from lewd innuendo, ogling and remarks about Ms. Carlson's body to demands for sex as a way for her to improve her job standing.\" Those remarks reportedly included statements about Carlson's legs and behind, requests that she wear form-fitting outfits, and \"sexist comments.\" She also claims she was fired in 2013 from her co-host chair on Fox & Friends and given less money for her own show after she complained about \"demeaning and discriminatory behavior on and off the set,\" specifically from co-host Steve Doocy, per an attorney statement. \"Opposing sexism and rejecting unwanted sexual come-ons should never cost a woman her job or subject her to disparagement and emotional anguish,\" another lawyer tells Politico. As for Carlson herself, she says in her own statement: \"I have strived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career. Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace.\" Read Ailes' response here.<|endoftext|>"}

The areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn\u2019t migrate back to the original habitat. \n \n The cost of the whole effort, including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species, is $50 million. \n \n The Marines at the Twentynine Palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering. \n \n The campaign goes back to 2008, when the Corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law. \n \n The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act handed land formerly managed by the Bureau of Land Management to the Defense Department.

When you think of panic-buying, you wouldn\u2019t think of candy. But that is exactly what\u2019s happening right now. People are panic-buying Necco wafers candy in bulk. \n \n The panic began on March 12. That day the Boston Globe covered an announcement from Necco CEO, Michael McGee, that they could be shutting down within 60 days. \n \n The Globe\u2019s piece coincides with a marked spike in sales. Necco sales have spiked more than 50% more than 82%. Necco Wafers are up 63% 150%! A clear signal of panic-buying. \n \n EDIT: Due to increased media attention in the past days, we have had to adjust these figures. Way up! \n \n Embed this Source: Bulk candy sales from CandyStore.com \n \n Short for New England Confectionary Company (\u201cCo\u201d), Necco is the maker of Necco Wafers, Mary Janes, Clark Bars, Candy Buttons, Squirrel Nut Zippers and more beloved old-fashioned candy. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of Sweethearts candy conversation hearts \u2013 aka the most popular Valentine\u2019s Day candy? Yeah, they make those too. \n \n After months of trying to find a buyer, they haven\u2019t been able to reach a deal. If no deal comes soon, hundreds of workers will be laid off and millions of candy lovers disappointed. \n \n This is a big deal. Necco has been around since the mid 1800s. Almost all of their candies are legends in their own right. All of them are in jeopardy now. \n \n The graph above illustrates daily sales for Necco Wafers in March this year on CandyStore.com. You can see where things change on the 12th and stay high above that until the time of this article on March 28. As a private company, we don\u2019t share specific sales numbers. But you can see the relative change in sales. It\u2019s not subtle. \n \n Online bulk candy stores like CandyStore.com are stockpiling Necco candies, but orders are coming in fast. We contacted industry partners and distributors and they are reporting the same phenomenon. The big question is, when will the shipments stop coming? \n \n No one can say,...\n\n\nArticle:  Necco wafers have been around since before the Civil War\u2014and plenty of detractors would argue they taste like it, too. \n \n The flavors have been described as \u201ctropical drywall,\u201d \u201cplaster surprise,\u201d and \u201cattic citrus.\u201d One Twitter commentator calls it a candy that \u201conly a psychopath would like.\u201d \n \n And yet, like anything appreciated only after it... \n\n\nArticle:  NECCO-Mania: Fans Stock Up On Chalky Wafers In Case Candy Company Folds \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Dina Rudick/Boston Globe via Getty Images Dina Rudick/Boston Globe via Getty Images \n \n NECCO wafers are a polarizing candy. Some online haters have compared the brittle sugar disks to chalk, or antacid tablets. But now, the company that makes them could soon close shop \u2014 and that's brought out some of the candies' very loyal fans. \n \n At Sugar Heaven in Somerville, Mass., David Sapers points out that there is a lot more NECCO on his shelves than just those controversial wafers. NECCO buttons and NECCO Sky Bars share shelf space with the classic wafers at his store. \n \n \"Also NECCO makes things like Squirrel Nut Zippers, Mary Janes, Slap Stix. And obviously during Valentine's they're big with their ... conversation hearts,\" he says. \n \n NECCO is an acronym for the New England Confectionery Co., which is in financial trouble. If its leaders can't find a buyer by early May, the company says it will have to shut down, laying off hundreds of workers at its factory in Revere, Mass. The company didn't respond to requests for an interview. But at Sugar Heaven, Sapers is getting ready. \n \n \"I just ordered 10 cases of [NECCO's products] yesterday, which were delivered on Thursday. So I did that because first of all, they don't go bad. They're going to last for a while, and just in case something happens, we have it.\" \n \n Customers Inge Nakel and Michelle Scannell buy some candy, including a roll of NECCO wafers. The classic roll has an incongruous mix of flavors, including orange, licorice and clove. \n \n \"I love the chocolate ones,\" says Nakel. \n \n \"You can buy a whole roll of chocolate. That's the best thing in the entire world,\" Scannell says. \n \n \"You know what's best, is their conversation hearts,\" says Nakel. Scannell agrees. \n \n Those candy hearts with little amorous messages on them are a Valentine's Day staple, and Sapers says Sugar Heaven will buy up as many as it can if it looks like NECCO won't...\n", "completion": "CandyStore.com is calling it \"the Great NECCO Wafer Panic,\" and that's no exaggeration. Terrified by reports that the New England Confectionery Co. may soon be out of business, fans of the candy company's sugar wafers are stocking up, with one woman offering to exchange her 2003 Honda Accord for CandyStore.com's hefty stash. The offer was refused, so she bought 48 rolls instead, reports the Boston Globe. Jon Prince of CandyFavorites.com tells NPR that another fan tried to buy his entire stock of NECCO Wafers and cried after learning sales were being limited. \"They said they couldn't imagine a world without their NECCO wafers,\" says Prince. Of course, not everyone loves the wafers, which come in flavors like chocolate, clove, and licorice. \"I mean, it is really like chewing on chalk,\" one man tells NPR. More likely to be missed are NECCO's conversation hearts, always a hit around Valentine's Day. A few weeks after this year's holiday, NECCO said it would be forced to close\u2014meaning 395 lost jobs at its factory in Revere, Mass.\u2014unless it found a buyer by May. NECCO sales on CandyStore.com have jumped 82% in the aftermath, while wafer sales have spiked 150%.

In a juicy New York Post excerpt, Sanchez claims that he overheard Castro meeting with a loyal general, Jos\u00e9 Abrantes, about drug trafficking: \"What business!\" Sanchez writes, with co-writer Axel Gylden. \"Very simply, a huge drug-trafficking transaction was being carried out at the highest echelons of the state.\" According to the book, Castro and Gen. Abrantes discussed smuggling cocaine into the US. Castro's reasoning: \"If the Yanks were stupid enough to use drugs that came from Colombia, not only was that not his problem ... it served his revolutionary objectives in the sense that it corrupted and destabilized American society,\" the book reads. Sanchez also accuses Castro of covering up his involvement by engineering sham trials that led to the deaths of two devoted officers, including Abrantes; this fueled the alcoholism of brother Raul, who feared he would be next. Imprisoned in Cuba for two years before fleeing, Sanchez has already accused Castro of secretly living a luxurious life that includes an 88-foot yacht and a Caribbean getaway island, the Miami Herald reported last year.<|endoftext|>"}

And while city gun violence typically doesn't get as much attention as other mass shootings, especially in more affluent neighborhoods, the Chicago story fits into the bigger national conversation on gun control, just slightly more than six months after the Newtown shootings shook the issue into the spotlight. \n \n This weekend was the most violent so far in the city, but not the most deadly: eight died in Chicago during the last weekend in January. The Chicago Tribune has a sweeping feature report on the weekend's toll on the city. Victims this weekend include Kevin Rivera, a 16-year-old who tried to flee gunmen on his bike; Ricardo Herrera, 21; Todd Wood, 40, who was killed in a mass shooting at a club (two others were wounded); Cortez Wilberton, 31; Jamal Jones, 19; and Antwon Johnson, 24, who was shot by police: \n \n \"[Johnson was shot] after he raised a 9-millimeter handgun in their direction after bailing from a moving car and falling, police said.

The presence of a police car behind them must have made Johnson nervous, his mother said.\" \n \n Liberty told the Tribune that Johnson had a record, but \"hasn\u2019t been in trouble in a while.\" His job search was struggling because of his criminal record, she added. \n \n What's perhaps most striking about the Tribune report is the amount of residue from the violence still left on the streets, which they describe as \"literally stained:\" \n \n \"In the city\u2019s Little Village neighborhood, 15 lit memorial candles stood in blood...About five miles away, a long trail of blood remained splattered in a...\n\n\nArticle:  6 dead, at least 41 injured in city\u2019s most violent weekend in 2013 BY MITCH DUDEK Staff Reporter mdudek@suntimes.com \n \n 24887084 \n \n Updated: \n \n The most violent weekend in Chicago this year left at least 41 people injured and six others dead from gunfire. \n \n Those killed ranged in age from 16 to 40. \n \n \u201cI had a family from my parish tell me recently that their 10-year-old son didn\u2019t want to come back to Chicago from vacation because of the violence,\u201d said Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Catholic Church in Englewood, which is about a mile from the site of one of the shootings. \n \n Friends and family gathered Sunday outside the Humboldt Park home of Kevin Rivera to sign a poster and light candles to remember the 16-year-old. He was killed late Saturday when a gunman on a bicycle shot Rivera as he walked in an alley not far from his home on the 1500 block of North Keystone. He collapsed down the block from where he was shot about 11:45 p.m. \n \n Earlier Saturday, about 10:50 p.m., Ricardo Herrera, 21, was killed and two others were wounded in a shooting in the Little Village neighborhood when a gunman opened fire in the 2500 block of South Ridgeway Avenue. Herrera, of the 2400 block of South Marshall Boulevard, was dead at the scene. \n \n A few minutes after midnight Sunday, 40-year-old Todd Wood, of the 8100 block of South St. Lawrence Avenue, was killed and three others were wounded when a gunman walked up to the open door of the club in the 900 block of East 79th Street in the Chatham neighborhood and opened fire. The men had argued outside the club before the attack. \n \n About an hour later, Jamal Jones, 19, was discovered on a sidewalk in the 7400 block of South Parnell Avenue with gunshot wounds to the shoulder and chest, police said. Jones, of the 8800 block of South Yale Avenue, died about an hour later at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn. \n \n Cortez Wilberton, 31, of the 200 block of South Lavergne Avenue, was fatally shot about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.

It was time to tell her son the news, and she didn't want him hearing it from anyone else. \n \n But her composure unraveled as she walked toward the car, a barrage of neighbors hugging her on the way out of her apartment. By the time she reached the front lawn, the mother of six was in tears. \n \n \"Our son is dead! Oh Jesus!\" the 57-year-old screamed, referring to Cortez, one of her three sons, who was killed earlier that morning on Chicago's West Side. \"Oh my God! Oh my God! We were just talking.\" \n \n At least 34 people were shot \u2014 nine of them fatally \u2014 Saturday afternoon through Father's Day Sunday, stretching from 94th Street and Loomis Avenue on the South Side up to about North Avenue and North Pulaski Road on the Northwest Side, according to authorities. The youngest person killed during one of the bloodiest weekends in Chicago this year, 15-year-old Michael Westley, was fatally shot by a police officer Sunday night. \n \n Shootings from Friday afternoon into Saturday left another 13 people shot, 1 fatally. The combined tally resulted in 47 people shot, and eight killed this weekend. Last year at about the same time, there were 53 people shot, nine fatally in one weekend. \n \n The rash of violent crime came as Chicago has seen a large dip in overall homicide and shooting numbers so far this year. \n \n When asked whether this weekend's shooting numbers cast doubt on the department's crime-fighting strategies, Chicago police spokesman Adam Collins insisted they are working, noting the city has so far in 2013 posted its lowest homicide totals in years. \n \n Collins also reiterated a position that police Superintendent Garry McCarthy has expressed publicly throughout the year when discussing the department's crime-fighting efforts. \"There's going to be good days, and...\n", "completion": "The news out of Chicago just five days ago was encouraging: after a murder-riddled 2012, this year's murder rate had plummeted to a level not seen in 50 years. Today, the news is of a darker nature. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday, a total of 46 people were shot in the city, seven fatally, per the Tribune. (Other sources put the tally slightly lower.) The stat does represent a sort of improvement: The Tribune reports that around this time last year, those numbers were 53 and nine, respectively. And the Atlantic Wire notes that a deadlier weekend has already occurred in 2013: January closed with eight deaths. The youngest victim, 16-year-old Kevin Rivera, apparently tried to flee from a gunman on a bicycle late Saturday.

UW research shows biannual spike in divorce filings \n \n Deborah Bach News and Information \n \n To everything there is a season \u2014 even divorce, new research from University of Washington sociologists concludes. \n \n Associate sociology professor Julie Brines and doctoral candidate Brian Serafini found what is believed to be the first quantitative evidence of a seasonal, biannual pattern of filings for divorce.

But because the light can\u2019t exist without the dark, then there must be a season for divorce, too, right? Of course there is, says science. \n \n While many are falling over themselves in love during the spring, a new study has found that divorce filings spike seasonally, too. The study by associate sociology professor Julie Brines and doctoral candidate Brian Serafini, both of the University of Washington, examined filings for divorce in Washington State from 2001 to 2015. What they found is that there is, indeed, a season for divorce, or rather two months out of the year where people are most likely to file for it: March and August. \n \n \u201cPeople tend to face the holidays with rising expectations, despite what disappointments they might have had in years past,\u201d Brines said in a press release. \u201cThey represent periods in the year when there\u2019s the anticipation or the opportunity for a new beginning, a new start, something different, a transition into a new period of life.

When the researchers plotted the data from 2001 to 2015, the divorce spike in those two months was both striking and consistent, they write in a press release. And while that data comes exclusively from Washington state, it seems to apply nationwide. The researchers followed up with a look at data from Ohio, Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona, and found the same pattern. So what's going on? They think winter holidays and summer vacations are a big factor. These are both \"culturally sacred times for families,\" says associate sociology professor Julie Brines, per the UW release. That is, couples may be reluctant to split around Christmas, or just ahead of an annual vacation, and instead view those times instead as an opportunity to mend a troubled relationship. \"One last shot,\" as Brines puts it, per the Atlantic. If they fail, the added stress of the holidays or the tight quarters of a vacation then push the couple toward divorce. The delay from post-holidays to March in the divorce filings may be because the holidays put such a heavy dent in the wallet, notes Bustle. That's less of an issue in the summer, and the researchers speculate that, for couples with kids, the start of school may actually speed things along.

When they chose correctly, they received a treat. John Bohannon at Science offers more details: \n \n [R]esearchers had 16 pigeons do all their learning once per day in a box with a computer screen without humans visible. Previously diagnosed histopathology slides from biopsies of breast tissue appeared on a computer touchscreen along with a yellow and a blue button. If the birds correctly identified cancer, they were automatically rewarded by the computer with a food pellet. If they were wrong, they got nothing. The computer not only randomized the order of images from benign or malignant tissue, but also whether yellow or blue signified \u201ccancer\u201d for any particular bird, to make sure the color itself didn\u2019t introduce bias.

Key insights into human behavioral tasks can often be obtained by using appropriate animal models. We report here that pigeons (Columba livia)\u2014which share many visual system properties with humans\u2014can serve as promising surrogate observers of medical images, a capability not previously documented. The birds proved to have a remarkable ability to distinguish benign from malignant human breast histopathology after training with differential food reinforcement; even more importantly, the pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned when confronted with novel image sets. The birds\u2019 histological accuracy, like that of humans, was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color as well as by degrees of image compression, but these impacts could be ameliorated with further training. Turning to radiology, the birds proved to be similarly capable of detecting cancer-relevant microcalcifications on mammogram images. However, when given a different (and for humans quite difficult) task\u2014namely, classification of suspicious mammographic densities (masses)\u2014the pigeons proved to be capable only of image memorization and were unable to successfully generalize when shown novel examples. The birds\u2019 successes and difficulties suggest that pigeons are well-suited to help us better understand human medical image perception, and may also prove useful in performance assessment and development of medical imaging hardware, image processing, and image analysis tools. \n \n Copyright: \u00a9 2015 Levenson et al.

Pigeons turn out to be expert mammogram readers after very little training, at least according to a study published this week in PLoS ONE. Using 16 pigeons in a chamber with a touchscreen, scientists trained them to peck at one of two colored buttons to correspond with the type of image they were being shown; if they got it right, they got food. It turns out that those beady little eyes picked up patterns showing malignant versus benign breast tissue very well and very fast. At first, as they were trained for what to spot, they were right 50% of the time. \"In some sense, the pigeon and the person are starting at the same place,\" says one researcher, experimental psychologist Edward Wasserman. \"They're equally naive.\" But a mere two weeks into the experiment the pigeons were identifying the images correctly 85% of the time, reports the Washington Post. What's more, the birds were able to take what they'd learned from the first, familiar set of slides and apply it to new images they'd never seen before, boasting a success rate that was just a few percentage points lower. And they performed even better as a flock than individually\u2014with a success rate maxing out at 99% when required to \"vote\" as a group, reports Gizmodo. It's more likely that robots, not pigeons, will be the ones to take the place of humans someday.

In a statement cited by the Times, Cuomo said he's setting up a task force, effective immediately, to check salons individually, come up with mandates to protect workers from possibly dangerous chemicals wafting around their salons, and conduct a six-language educational campaign to let workers know this kind of debasement isn't OK. \"We will not stand idly by as workers are deprived of their hard-earned wages and robbed of their most basic rights,\" Cuomo said in the statement. Several government agencies, including the Health Department, were spurred into action last week after the two-part Times article ran. Rules going into effect ASAP include publicly posted signage (in different languages) in salons listing workers' rights, a requirement that manicurists wear gloves and masks, and a mandate that all salons are bonded so employees can recoup wages if it's found they've been denied rightful earnings, per the Times. Cuomo's office says the task force agencies won't probe workers' immigration status.

Ninety percent of tobacco grown in the US is cultivated in four states: North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.

Now the sighting has been described in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. \n \n The marine scientists were out on a research expedition when they detected strange calls on their vessel\u2019s underwater microphones, alerting them to the presence of killer whales in their vicinity. \n \n After finding the whales responsible for the noises, the researchers noticed some splashing that they thought might be a sign that the orcas were hunting.

(Jared Towers) \n \n Infanticide isn't unheard of among mammals. Lions do it. Primates do it. Even some bears do it, but it hadn't been documented in killer whales before. \n \n Towers described the distressing scene as something that he'll never unsee, but the researchers quickly realized the significance of the event and stuck around to watch the aftermath. \n \n Over the next few minutes, they observed as the calf's mother and her relatives chased the male around, while the male's mother tried to fend them off. There was more splashing, and a hydrophone below the water captured the frantic calls of the whales. \n \n \"That all kind of came to a grinding halt when the mother of the infant hit the male so hard that \u2026 his blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air. That was kind of the final impact, but he never let go of the infant,\" Towers recalled. \n \n The male killer whale holds the calf in its mouth....\n\n\nArticle:  (SEATTLE) \u2014 With the number of endangered orcas that frequent the inland waters of Washington state at a 30-year low, Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday directed state agencies to take immediate and longer-term steps to protect the struggling killer whales. \n \n The fish-eating mammals that spend time in Puget Sound have struggled for years with a lack of food, pollution, noise and disturbances from boat traffic. There are now just 76 of the orcas, down from 98 in 1995. \n \n Inslee said the orcas are in trouble and called on everyone in the state to do their part. His executive order aims to make more salmon available to the whales, give them more space and quieter waters, ensure they have clean water to swim in and protect them from potential oil spills. \n \n \u201cThe destiny of salmon and orca and we humans are intertwined,\u201d the governor said at a news conference at the Daybreak Star Cultural Center in Seattle. \u201cAs the orca go, so go we.\u201d \n \n An orca task force forming now will meet for the first time next month and will come up with final recommendations by November. \n \n \u201cThis is a wake-up call,\u201d Suquamish Tribal Chairman Leonard Forsman said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some pain. We\u2019re going to have to make some sacrifices.\u201d \n \n Many have been sounding the alarm for years about the plight of the closely tracked population of southern resident killer whales. The federal government listed the orcas as endangered in 2005, and more recently identified them as among the most at risk of extinction in the near future. \n \n A baby orca has not been born in the past few years. Half of the calves born during a celebrated baby boom several years ago have died. Female orcas also are having pregnancy problems linked to nutritional stress brought on by a low supply of chinook salmon, the whales\u2019 preferred food, a recent study said. \n \n \u201cWe are not too late,\u201d said Barry Thom, West Coast regional administrator for NOAA Fisheries. \u201cFrom a biology perspective, there are still enough breeding animals, but we need to act soon.\u201d \n \n...\n\n\nArticle:  WCT killer whales may be well adapted behaviourally for performing infanticide because of their experience killing other small cetaceans. Individuals typically dispatch these prey by ramming or crushing them with their rostrums or tails36. Observations of infanticidal behaviour towards young common bottlenose dolphins, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and a Guiana dolphin by conspecifics have included repeated ramming and crushing actions but also forced submergence4,5,6,7,8,9. Although we did not observe the first few minutes of this incident closely enough to determine the details of interactions that took place, it appeared as though T046B5 was quickly immobilized by having its tail gripped in the teeth of T068A and subsequently drowned because there was no opportunity to surface and breath due to his consistent forward motion. Although both T068 and T068A were observed with fresh teeth scars after the incident, the only ramming behaviour we observed was performed by T046B toward her neonate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killer. This combative behaviour is similar to actions directed towards infanticidal males by the mothers of targeted infants in several rodent, primate and carnivore species (see review in13). The ramming occurred approximately ten minutes after the incident began, at which point the neonate would have been either close to or freshly drowned, which is probably why the fight did not persist. The brevity of this physical aggression might be typical of agonistic interactions between members of the WCT killer whale population. This, in addition to the fact that most exchanges between individuals take place below the surface, may help explain why none of this nature have previously been observed. Similarly, anomalistic calls are not commonly made by whales in this population42, but as many animals are known to produce atypical sounds under stressful situations43, the high number of aberrant and discrete pulsed calls and other excited sounds recorded before and during the infanticide event likely reflect the levels of...\n", "completion": "Scientists have observed a behavior never before seen in killer whales, and it makes for a grim discovery. Following strange calls from orcas off the northeastern coast of British Columbia's Vancouver Island in December, researchers observed the first known case of infanticide among the whales. After tracking down the orcas and hearing a ruckus in the water, the scientists spotted a male orca with a newborn calf in its mouth, being chased by the calf's mother and other members of its family. As the male's mother attempted to intervene, the calf's mother \"hit the male so hard that ... his blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air,\" ecologist Jared Towers tells the CBC. \"We were really quite horrified and fascinated.\" The male still didn't let go of the calf, which had died by that point, according to Newsweek. Researchers, describing the case in Scientific Reports, say the male orca likely killed the calf so the male orca could mate with the infant's mother. In other mammals, infanticide \"forces the infant's mom into a fertile state much quicker,\" Towers says. He adds researchers previously thought female orcas were picky about mates, but this behavior suggests \"females don't have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding.\" The CBC notes $9 million the Canadian government has dedicated to orca research may reveal more about the endangered species in time, as Washington state works on protection, per Time.

I love this NBA narrative so, so much, and I\u2019d like to thank Shaq for breathing more life into it. \n \n Cleveland Cavaliers star Kyrie Irving was the first NBA player to reveal his flat-Earth beliefs, summarized as such: \u201cCan you really think of us rotating around the sun, and all planets align, rotating in specific dates, being perpendicular with what\u2019s going on with these \u2018planets\u2019 and stuff like this?\u201d \n \n Soon afterwards, Denver Nuggets wing Wilson Chandler and Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green endorsed Irving\u2019s flat-Earth theory, with the latter explaining away NASA\u2019s photos of the planet from space by suggesting everyone can manipulate doctored photos of the globe on their phones. \n \n [Follow Ball Don\u2019t Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr] \n \n The NBA storyline became so outrageous commissioner Adam Silver had to address it in his annual state-of-the-league address at the All-Star Game, clarifying, \u201cI believe the world is round,\u201d and suggesting Irving was making some broader social commentary about fake news in this country. \n \n Which, no he wasn\u2019t. Irving doubled down on his flat-Earth theory this past week, before detailing his lucid dreaming skills and informing us how an ex-teammate came to him in a dream to say goodbye. \n \n These are all very real things that NBA players have said. \n \n This is one wild theme to the 2016-17 NBA season, and Shaq just made it wilder when asked about Irving\u2019s flat-Earth theory on his podcast. This was his response, through a series of interruptions: \n \n Shaq is a flat-Earther, too I\u2019m speechless I love this NBA narrative so muchhttps://t.co/eijTsZKJZm pic.twitter.com/3zOLbABfeQ \u2014 Ben Rohrbach (@brohrbach) March 19, 2017 \n \n Story Continues \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s true.

Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers first revealed his flat-Earth beliefs back in February, and now retired basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has revealed he's on the same page. In an episode of his podcast broadcast late February but only recently picked up by the media, Shaq said, per Sports Illustrated: \"It\u2019s true. The Earth is flat. The Earth is flat. Yes, it is. Listen, there are three ways to manipulate the mind\u2014what you read, what you see, and what you hear.\" He used an example involving Christopher Columbus, arguing that Columbus didn't really discover America because there were already \"fair-skinned people\" living here when Columbus arrived. Then he got into the real nitty gritty. He explained that he drives from coast to coast, and it certainly seems flat to him: \"I\u2019m just saying. I drive from Florida to California all the time, and it\u2019s flat to me. I do not go up and down at a 360-degree angle, and all that stuff about gravity, have you looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings? You mean to tell me that China is under us? China is under us? It\u2019s not. The world is flat.\" Kenny Ducey at SI says that while he wants to believe this is all a joke, both Irving and O'Neal seem to be taking it seriously; Irving, for example, has continued to defend his beliefs. Ben Rohrbach at Yahoo Sports, who first uncovered the Shaq podcast, agrees that Irving is not kidding around (or trying to make some sort of point about \"fake news,\" as NBA commissioner Adam Silver suggested), and points out that at least two other NBA players have agreed with him.<|endoftext|>"}

The cause was cancer and cirrhosis, as Penny Arcade, a fellow Warhol superstar who raised funds for Woodlawn in her final days, told The Washington Post in a telephone interview. \n \n \u201cThere was no role model for a Holly Woodlawn,\u201d Arcade said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a time where the reward was freedom in itself. For Holly, whatever sacrifices she made in terms of acceptance of her family and society could never compete with the sense of freedom that Holly needed \u2013 the freedom to be herself.\u201d \n \n Woodlawn was born Haroldo Santiago Franceschi Rodriguez Danhakl in 1946 in Puerto Rico. She was not repressed. \n \n \u201cI was raised in Puerto Rico for the first few years of my life, where the culture is more Caribbean,\u201d Woodlawn told the Guardian in 2007. \u201cEveryone\u2019s naked, it\u2019s hotter, you come out earlier. I was having sex when I was seven and eight in the bushes with my uncles and cousins \u2014 of course, they were only 11 or 12 themselves. I was raised in a house full of women and my uncle was gay.\u201d \n \n Still, Woodlawn didn\u2019t really recognize the he she started out as. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t even know who he was,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was extremely shy and living in what\u2019s now Miami Beach. My father had a nice job. I guess we were middle income. I had good schools. I just was unhappy because I didn\u2019t know who I was.\u201d \n \n As Reed so memorably wrote, Woodlawn left home...\n", "completion": "Holly Woodlawn, one of Andy Warhol's \"drag queen superstars\" who was also immortalized in Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side,\" died Sunday at age 69 after battling cancer, the AP reports. Born in Puerto Rico, her mother moved Holly\u2014who was, at that point, Harold\u2014to New York and then Miami Beach, the New York Times reports. Woodlawn hitchhiked back to New York at 16, where she was a go-go dancer, among other things: \"I was turning tricks, living off the streets and wondering when my next meal was coming,\" she wrote in her 1991 memoir. While performing in a friend's musical in 1969, Woodlawn told a journalist that she was one of Warhol's superstars, and though that wasn't actually true at that point, her comment got his attention and led to what the Times refers to as Woodlawn's \"underground stardom.\" Warhol's filmmaking partner Paul Morrissey cast her in the 1970 film Trash as the girlfriend of a heroin addict, and the performance got good reviews. She went on to star alongside two other transgender actresses in Morrissey's 1971 film Women in Revolt; both films were produced by Warhol. In 1972, Reed wrote the first lines of his now-classic song about Woodlawn at Warhol's suggestion, the Washington Post reports: \"Holly came from Miami F-L-A / Hitchhiked her way across the USA / Plucked her eyebrows on the way / Shaved her legs and then he was a she / She says, 'Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side.'\" She went on to do a few more films and perform as a cabaret artist, but by the end of the 1970s she was working at a Benihana in Miami. She moved to California in the 1990s, where she studied fashion design and had a few more roles, most recently in Amazon's Transparent.

What's more, Lindsay also faces jail time for a probation violation in the jewelry heist case because she allegedly lied to cops after the crash. We're told the judge could have agreed to end both cases if Lindsay checked into rehab.But Shawn never made it to court, because Lindsay signed her walking papers and hired a New York lawyer who was suspended in the '90s from practicing law for 5 years.Lindsay now says she wants Shawn back. The question -- does Shawn have the stomach for another helping of Lindsay?There's a hearing scheduled for 8:30 AM PT today. Shawn will probably show up because she's still counsel of record. If she stays on the case, prosecutors could present the deal to her, but Lindsay is making it all very difficult. \n\n\nArticle:  Lindsay Lohan never seems to make things easy. First, there were tabloid reports that she fired her longtime lawyer, Shawn Holley, just as Holley was about to go make a plea deal and help the star out of jet another legal jam. Then later this morning in Los Angeles, Holley appeared in court on Lohan's behalf, entering her plea of not guilty. \n \n Lohan's arraignment had to do with her car wreck during the filming of car wreck Liz & Dick in June. Per the AP, Lohan, who was on probation for her jewelry theft case at the time, is charged with lying to police about whether or not she was behind the wheel, obstructing police from doing their job, and reckless driving. \n \n But yesterday it seemed like there would be a major hitch to today's proceedings (at which Lohan was not required to attend). Per TMZ, Holley was heading to court yesterday to make a plea deal for Lohan when Lohan fired her. The deal would have kept Lohan out of jail and put her in rehab. Holley was apparently replaced by New York lawyer Mark Heller, who has a quite fascinating tale of his own, according to this 2010 New York Times profile. Heller was speaking on Lohan's behalf around the time of her November arrest for assault. \n \n So in court today the judge asked Holley if she still represented Lohan. Holley responded, per TMZ: \"At this point, yes.\" Lohan is now scheduled to appear January 30. \n \n Want to add to this story?

Other \"insiders\" back him up, including one who says that the days-long \"dates\" include LiLo's hotel and travel costs, food, jewelry, and \"other gifts.\" But no sex\u2014or at least, not that anyone is saying.

She could still be facing jail time for allegedly lying to police after her June car accident, but her longtime attorney Shawn Holley planned to make a plea deal involving rehab for Lindsay instead.

{"prompt": "What are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: Helsinki, 5 July 2016: Despite the positive results of small studies and a widely held belief in its benefit, the practice of keeping female patients immobilised after intrauterine insemination has no beneficial effect on pregnancy rates, according to results of a large randomised study presented here at the Annual Meeting of ESHRE in Helsinki.(1) \"Indeed,\" said investigator Joukje van Rijswijk from the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, \"it even tends to the opposite.\" \n \n Behind her conclusions lies a large randomised comparative study in which 479 patients with standard indications for IUI (unexplained or mild male factor infertility) were randomly assigned to 15 minutes of immobilisation immediately after insemination or to immediate mobilisation. With most patients having several cycles of IUI in their treatment course, the comparison was based on a total of 950 cycles of immobilisation and 984 cycles of mobilisation. \n \n Results showed that the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate per couple (that is, after the total course of treatment, which in some cases ran to six cycles) was comparable between the two groups - a pregnancy rate of 32.2% after 15 minutes of immobilisation and 40.3% after immediate mobilisation. These differences were not statistically significant, despite the trend, indicating no benefit from a brief period of bed rest after insemination. \"In our opinion,\" said Dr van Rijswijk, \"immobilisation after IUI has no positive effect on pregnancy rates, and there is no reason why patients should stay immobilised after treatment.\" \n \n She acknowledged that these results were \"in disagreement with the literature\", from which a widespread acceptance of bed rest after IUI had evolved. A smaller study published last year from the Middle East found that ten and 15 minutes of immobilisation following IUI (compared to five minutes) had a beneficial effect on pregnancy rates. However, the results were based on just one cycle of treatment and not on the more real-world context of multiple cycles....\n\n\nArticle:  Noah Salzgeber / EyeEm/ Getty \n \n If you\u2019ve ever tried to get pregnant, you\u2019ll almost certainly have heard that it helps if a woman lies still after her partner ejaculates. But this is unlikely to make a difference, a study suggests. \n \n The idea is that lying down for a while gives the sperm time to reach their destination egg. The same theory has been applied to intra-uterine insemination (IUI), a fertility treatment that involves injecting sperm directly into a woman\u2019s uterus. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety that after IUI if you stand up, everything will fall out,\u201d says Nick Macklon of the University of Southampton, UK. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Some research has backed up the theory. Some small studies in 2009 and 2015 found that 15 minutes of bed rest improved IUI success rates, leading to more pregnancies. But now Joukje van Rijswijk at the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam in the Netherlands and her colleagues have conducted a larger study. \n \n The team randomly assigned 479 women receiving IUI to either 15 minutes of bed rest or to get up and move around straight after treatment. Most of the women had several rounds of treatment \u2013 in total, the group collected data on almost 2000 IUI cycles. \n \n They found that 32 per cent of the cycles that incorporated bed rest resulted in pregnancy, but 40 per cent of cycles that involved immediate movement were successful. \u201cIn our opinion, immobilisation after IUI has no positive effect on pregnancy rates,\u201d says van Rijswijk. \u201cThere is no reason why patients should stay immobilised after treatment.\u201d \n \n Although the results contradict previous findings, they make sense. For example, it is known that sperm can survive in the uterus for several days \u2013 there is no reason why bed rest would affect this, says van Rijswijk, who presented the findings this week at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Endocrinology annual meeting in Helsinki, Finland. \n \n Our crude understanding of female anatomy is partly to blame for the theory, says Adam Balen, chair of the...\n", "completion": "Good news for those trying to conceive: A new study suggests there's no reason for you to continue lying down, immobile, after having sex. There's a widespread belief that lying still after sex helps give the sperm time to get where they need to go, and the same belief has transferred over to women getting intra-uterine insemination (IUI), a fertility treatment in which sperm are injected directly into the uterus. \"There\u2019s a lot of anxiety that after IUI if you stand up, everything will fall out,\" an expert from the University of Southampton tells New Scientist. Two studies have found that resting in bed for 15 minutes after getting IUI did increase success rates, but they were small studies. The new, larger study out of Amsterdam's VU University Medical Center disputes that belief. Researchers looked at 479 women getting IUI, most of whom got multiple rounds; they collected information on nearly 2,000 cycles overall. Women were randomly assigned to either get up and move immediately after treatment or stay on bed rest for 15 minutes before moving. Of the cycles incorporating bed rest, 32% resulted in pregnancy\u2014while 40% of the cycles after which the women immediately moved resulted in pregnancy. \"In our opinion,\" says the lead researcher in a press release, \"immobilization after IUI has no positive effect on pregnancy rates, and there is no reason why patients should stay immobilized after treatment.\" She would not \"generalize\" the results to give advice to couples attempting to get pregnant via traditional intercourse, but the Southampton expert thinks the study likely applies there, too.

Tuite and Dr. Robert Haley, who has written several papers asserting links between chemical exposures and gulf war illnesses. They assembled data from meteorological and intelligence reports to support their thesis that American bombs were powerful enough to propel sarin from depots in Muthanna and Falluja high into the atmosphere, where winds whisked it hundreds of miles south to the Saudi border. \n \n Once over the American encampments, the toxic plume could have stalled and fallen back to the surface because of weather conditions, the paper says.

(Photo: Peter Dejong, AP) Story Highlights Weather studies show dangerous nerve agent traveled hundreds of miles to reach U.S. troops. \n \n WASHINGTON -- U.S. bombings of Iraqi munitions factories in January 1991 released a plume of sarin gas that traveled more than 300 miles to affect American troops in Saudi Arabia, although military officials claimed at the time that chemical alarms triggered by the gas were false, a study released today shows. \n \n The Jan. 18, 1991, bombings of the munitions plants in Nasiriyah and Khamisiya blew a plume of sarin gas high above a layer of cold, still air -- also called the boundary level -- and into a swift wind stream that carried the gas to Saudi Arabia, said the study conducted by researchers Robert Haley and James Tuite and published in the journal Neuroepidemiology. \n \n The gas plumes, the researchers said, can be blamed for symptoms of Gulf War illness, the mysterious ailment that has affected more than 250,000 veterans of the war. \n \n The gas set off repeated chemical weapons alarms at U.S. troop points in Saudi Arabia, the report said, but commanders said they were false alarms, because if the troops had been hit with sarin gas, there would have been casualties. There were no casualties, although U.S., Czech and French systems all detected traces of sarin and mustard agent. \n \n Compounding the effects of the sarin were Scud missile attacks on the bases by Iraqi forces, Haley and Tuite reported, because the missiles would stir up the airborne toxic gases and force the sarin to drift back into the base level of air, which would set off the chemical alarms again. \n \n The two researchers investigated satellite images...\n", "completion": "A controversial new paper may shed light on Gulf War syndrome, a collection of symptoms seen in veterans of the 1991 conflict: Chemical weapons could be to blame. The researchers assert that when US troops bombed chemical weapons depots in Iraq, the neurotoxin sarin was sent into the atmosphere then carried by the wind all the way to American encampments 300 miles to the south. From there, weather conditions may have driven the toxin downward, potentially exposing troops to it for several days. Troops were told that chemical weapons alarms that blared at the time were false alarms, the New York Times reports. The theory has been raised before; the new paper supports it using intelligence and weather reports. The researchers also noted a correlation between the number of times troops say they heard the alarm and the severity of their symptoms. Satellite images in the report show yellow gas over the US encampments, USA Today adds. Almost half of 700,000 Gulf War veterans have made claims for disability, with many citing symptoms whose cause remains mysterious.

The suit also challenges Oracle\u2019s systemic practice of favoring Asian workers in its recruiting and hiring practices for product development and other technical roles, which resulted in hiring discrimination against non-Asian applicants. \n \n Oracle designs, manufactures, and sells software and hardware products, as well as offers services related to its products to the federal government. \n \n The lawsuit filed by the department\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs is the result of an OFCCP compliance review of Oracle\u2019s equal employment opportunity practices at its Redwood Shores headquarters.

Around 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year. \n \n The CDC said there has been a 320% increase in the number of counties in the north-east US considered high risk for Lyme disease since the 1990s. Overall, more than 45% of all American counties now host the ticks, up from from 30% in 1998, according to the research published in the Journal of Medical Entomology. \n \n Reforestation and an increased population of deer, which host the ticks, have contributed to the increase in distribution.

Unfortunately, the range of blacklegged ticks had not been re-evaluated in nearly two decades, until now. \n \n Dr. Rebecca Eisen, a research biologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, observed that the last comprehensive survey of blacklegged tick distribution was published in 1998. To remedy this, she and her colleagues performed a new survey to establish the current geographic distribution. \n \n The team used surveillance methods similar to those used in 1998 so that they would be able to accurately judge the degree to which the distribution of these ticks had changed. Using the gathered data, they figured out which counties had established populations, which ones had one or more reports of a blacklegged ticks, and which ones had none. \n \n They found that the blacklegged tick has been reported in more than 45% of U.S. counties, compared to 30% of counties in 1998. Even more alarming, the blacklegged tick is now considered established in twice the number of counties as in 1998. \n \n Most of the geographic expansion of the blacklegged tick appears to be in the northern U.S., while populations in southern states have remained relatively stable. The range of the western blacklegged tick only increased from 3.4% to 3.6% of counties. \n \n \"This study shows that the distribution of Lyme disease vectors has changed substantially over the last nearly two decades and highlights areas where risk for human exposure to ticks has changed during that time,\" Dr. Eisen said. \"The observed range expansion of the ticks highlights a need for continuing and enhancing...\n\n\nArticle:  Ticks that transmit Lyme disease have significantly spread across the United States over the past 20 years, according to new research. \n \n The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in the Journal of Medical Entomology, found that the parasites that carry the disease -- known as blacklegged ticks -- are now found in nearly half of all U.S. counties. This was the first study since 1998 to examine where these ticks live. \n \n Each year, approximately 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the CDC, though the number is estimated to be much higher, as only a fraction of cases are actually reported. In fact, according to an analysis published last summer, health officials report the number of actual cases is closer to 329,000. \n \n The disease is transmitted to humans through tick bites, and typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a rash that often looks like a \"bulls-eye\" at the site of the tick bite. Most cases are easily treated with antibiotics, but in some patients, if left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to chronic joint inflammation and neurological problems weeks, months, or even years after infection. \n \n For the current study, Dr. Rebecca Eisen, a research biologist at the CDC, and her team looked at data from published reports of state and county tick surveillance data going back to 1996. They analyzed numbers from all 3,110 counties in the U.S. to determine where the ticks were \"established\" -- meaning there were sightings of at least six individual ticks or at least two of the three host-seeking life stages had been identified in a single year. The researchers also noted which counties had one or more reports of blacklegged ticks and which ones had none. \n \n The results showed that the blacklegged tick has been reported in more than 45 percent of U.S. counties, compared to 30 percent of counties in 1998.

Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. Lyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., rash), and the possibility of exposure to infected ticks. Laboratory testing is helpful if used correctly and performed with validated methods. Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics. Steps to prevent Lyme disease include using insect repellent, removing ticks promptly, applying pesticides, and reducing tick habitat. The ticks that transmit Lyme disease can occasionally transmit other tickborne diseases as well. \n\n\nArticle:  Abstract \n \n The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary vector to humans in the eastern United States of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , as well as causative agents of anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Its close relative in the far western United States, the western blacklegged tick Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls, is the primary vector to humans in that region of the Lyme disease and anaplasmosis agents. Since 1991, when standardized surveillance and reporting began, Lyme disease case counts have increased steadily in number and in geographical distribution in the eastern United States. Similar trends have been observed for anaplasmosis and babesiosis. To better understand the changing landscape of risk of human exposure to disease agents transmitted by I. scapularis and I. pacificus , and to document changes in their recorded distribution over the past two decades, we updated the distribution of these species from a map published in 1998. The presence of I. scapularis has now been documented from 1,420 (45.7%) of the 3,110 continental United States counties, as compared with 111 (3.6%) counties for I. pacificus . Combined, these vectors of B. burgdorferi and other disease agents now have been identified in a total of 1,531 (49.2%) counties spread across 43 states. This marks a 44.7% increase in the number of counties that have recorded the presence of these ticks since the previous map was presented in 1998, when 1,058 counties in 41 states reported the ticks to be present. Notably, the number of counties in which I. scapularis is considered established (six or more individuals or one or more life stages identified in a single year) has more than doubled since the previous national distribution map was published nearly two decades ago. The majority of county status changes occurred in the North-Central and Northeastern states, whereas the distribution in the South remained fairly stable.

That's up from 30% of counties in 1998, with the Guardian reporting that the number of Lyme disease incidents has tripled in the US since the '90s. The biggest increases were seen in northern and northeastern states, reports CBS News, which singles out Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin. It's not surprising, then, that while some 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported annually, the real figure is estimated at a staggering 330,000 people every year. While Lyme disease continues to be fairly easy to treat via antibiotics, if left untreated it can lead to serious symptoms, including chronic joint inflammation and even heart and neurological problems years after infection, reports the CDC, which adds that the best preventive measures are removing ticks as quickly as possible and applying pesticides. Biologists blame reforestation, growing deer populations, and climate change for the fast spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease, reports the Guardian, and the researchers note in a press release the rise of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in particular.

AFM is a rare but potentially severe condition that can arise following an infection, and in some cases it can lead to death, paralysis or other long-term health impacts. \n \n The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is investigating six cases of a rare condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) that occurred since mid-September in Minnesota children. \n \n AFM is a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system, causing muscles to weaken. It can be a complication following a viral infection, but environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to its development. AFM symptoms include sudden muscle weakness in the arms or legs, sometimes following a respiratory illness. Other symptoms may include: \n \n Neck weakness or stiffness \n \n Drooping eyelids or a facial droop. \n \n Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech. \n \n MDH disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases.

Symptoms usually include a sudden onset of arm or leg weakness and loss of muscle reflexes, but can also include drooping eyelids, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing. Treatment and therapy restores lost mobility in some children over time, but the syndrome can be fatal in those who lose the muscular function to breathe. \n \n James Hill of Lakeville said his son, Quinton, suffered typical cold symptoms at the start of one school week last month.

The state usually sees just one case of the illness per year, which the Star-Tribune reports has health officials now issuing alerts to doctors statewide. And, unlike the viral disease polio, AFM's more elusive cause means there is no vaccine. \"Disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases,\" the Minnesota Department of Public Health said in a statement. \"The department is also in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to share information.\" AFM most commonly affects young children and the cases in Minnesota, which are not isolated to one region but have instead been seen in multiple parts of the state, have all occurred in patients under age 10. AFM is believed to be most frequently triggered by some separate viral infection, leading officials to urge parents to ensure children follow basic preventative measures including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding mosquito bites when at all possible. Officials also want parents to be aware of early signs of AFM, which include weakness or stiffness of the neck, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech. With no vaccine, all doctors can do in these cases is treat symptoms and hope effects like limb paralysis aren't permanent. (Meanwhile, the CDC says the disease may be on the rise.)<|endoftext|>"}

It is that repeated and documented pattern of profiling, excessive force and shootings by police that we see in our communities and not in others. If we are to ever solve the issue of crime, we must tackle all crime \u2014 including crime committed by those who wear a badge. \n \n My organization, National Action Network, has dedicated over 25 years toward fighting for social justice and equality across the board. That struggle includes reducing crime and uplifting our communities on every level. In addition to holding gun buyback events, we\u2019ve coordinated programs like \u201cOccupy The Corner\u201d in cities like Chicago in order to help diffuse shootings.

Minnesota Democrats backed a woman who would be the first Somali-American member of Congress. And in Connecticut, the party nominated a candidate who could become the first black woman from the state to serve in Congress. \n \n Still, Democrats in Minnesota also backed a national party leader who is facing accusations of domestic violence.

Only 18 percent of Democratic respondents in the same poll said they had a favorable opinion of Ms. Hallquist, and 55 percent did not yet know who she was. \n \n That may change now that Ms. Hallquist is the nominee, and she is likely to draw national attention \u2014 and fund-raising dollars \u2014 because of the historic potential of her candidacy. \u201cShe\u2019ll raise more money and her message will get out there more,\u201d said Eric Davis, an emeritus professor at Vermont\u2019s Middlebury College. \u201cEven if she doesn\u2019t get elected governor, the greatest contribution of her campaign could be to raise awareness about the issues transgender people face.\u201d \n \n Before she ran for governor, Ms. Hallquist spent 12 years as the chief executive of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, an in-state power utility that she helped to bring back from near ruin. Her transition from male to female took place in 2015, while she was at the helm of the company, and was the subject of a documentary film made by her son. \n \n As a candidate, she made it part of her stump speech, drawing knowing laughs from her female supporters at a fund-raiser this summer as she talked about what it was like to experience life as a woman for the first time. \n \n \u201cI remember the first time after transitioning, a stranger walking by told me to smile \u2014 I\u2019m like, \u2018Who the heck are you to tell me to smile?\u2019\u201d Ms. Hallquist said. \u201cWhat my transition has taught me is just how far we have to go.\u201d \n\n\nArticle:  Despite a late-breaking accusation of abuse from an ex-girlfriend, Rep.

The porpoise, known for sporting a little smirk, is a marine mammal that would drown in the nets where they couldn't swim to the surface for air, and the appetite for totoaba has not diminished as the fish's bladder is used in Chinese medicine and considered a delicacy there, fetching more than $4,000 for just one. The Mexican government has frantically decided to try to capture the remaining survivors, now around 60, to try to save the species. The US is joining in, too, offering up another marine mammal to help: the dolphin. The US Navy is training the so-called Seal Team 6 of dolphins, which already prowl around for underwater mines, to find the last surviving vaquita, which live between the Mexican mainland and Baja California Peninsula. \"Their specific task is to locate,\" one expert says. \"They would signal that by surfacing and returning to the boat from which they were launched.\" Unfortunately, the vaquita doesn't thrive in captivity, where they would need to remain to be safe from fishing nets.

{"prompt": "What are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: The Education Department drastically underestimated the cost of the government's income-driven repayment plans for student loans in its original estimates, the Government Accountability Office said in a highly critical report Wednesday. \n \n The GAO report finds that estimates of the cost to the government of income-driven repayment plans -- which eventually discharge a student's remaining debt after 20 years or more of payments -- has jumped from $28 billion to $53 billion for student loans issued from 2009 to 2016. And it found that nearly a third of student loan debt expected to be repaid via income-driven repayments ($108 billion) will be forgiven by the federal government through programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. \n \n Observers of federal financial aid policy said those numbers -- and the apparent inability of the department to estimate the cost of student loan programs -- could provide new ammunition to Republican lawmakers looking to target expensive student aid programs to rein in costs, if not drastically downsize the department itself. The GAO investigated the costs of the income-driven repayment program at the request of Wyoming Republican Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \n \n The Obama administration made enrolling student loan borrowers in income-driven repayment plans a major tool for assisting borrowers struggling with student loan debt.

The government says it still expects the program to generate a profit over the long term, but it has repeatedly trimmed expectations for revenues. \n \n President Barack Obama has promoted income-driven repayment plans\u2014passed by Congress in the 1990s and 2000s\u2014to stem a sharp rise in borrowers defaulting on their loans since the recession.

Enrollment in these income-driven repayment plans is soaring and so is the cost, but the government\u2019s budget estimates are not keeping pace, an oversight that fuels criticism of a federal policy that conservatives say has become far too expensive. \n \n Current budget estimates for income-driven plans are more than double what was originally expected for loans made in fiscal 2009 through 2016, climbing from $25 billion to $53 billion, according to the GAO report.

Currently, $355 billion is owed under income-driven repayment plans, and the GAO report found that $137 billion of that will never be repaid. Of that, $108 billion will be forgiven under the terms of the plans, and $29 billion will be written off due to disability or death.

The order had been sought by Kondaur Capital Corp., a California firm that buys foreclosed properties and now owns the house. \n \n The Ritters could not be reached for comment. \n \n During the real estate boom, the Ritters earned six-figure incomes by flipping houses \u2014 buying and reselling rapidly.

They had said previously that they did not make payments because they were scrambling to save other investment properties from foreclosure. \n \n The mortgage on the million-dollar house passed through several lenders, at least two of which tried to foreclose.

In Ponar, this task was assigned to a group of 80 prisoners from the Stutthof concentration camp. \n \n At night the prisoners were kept in a deep pit which was previously used for the execution of Vilna's Jews.

{"prompt": "What are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: If the notion of any current country performer labeling himself an outlaw was ever laughable, it would never be more so when considering David Allan Coe. In reform school by the age of nine, and charged with such offenses as armed robbery and auto theft, Coe would be in and out of various correctional facilities for the next two decades and would serve three years at the Ohio State Penitentiary. \n \n Related Merle Haggard: 'Prison Is the Biggest Business in America' Country music's most famous ex-con speaks out on the number of Americans in prison and changes his stance on marijuana \n \n While he was behind bars, Coe penned several songs that would be released on his 1969 debut album, the dark and crudely recorded Penitentiary Blues, which resurfaced in 2005 getting its first CD release. Coe was encouraged to write the songs, which detail stark prison life in such songs as \"Death Row,\" \"Oh Warden\" and \"Cell #33,\" by the man in the cell next to him, soul singer Screamin' Jay Hawkins. After he was released in 1967, Coe released those tracks via Shelby Singleton's SSS International label, and began touring with B.B. King and the Staples Singers. A subsequent deal with Columbia Records yielded The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, a hardcore country effort co-produced by Billy Sherrill and Ron Bledsoe, which failed to chart. \n \n The next album from Coe, Once Upon a Rhyme, would give him the first of his three Top Ten hits. \"You Never Even Called Me By My Name\" was a stone-country, semi-novelty song written by Steve Goodman (\"City of New Orleans\") and John Prine (who refused a writer's credit but was gifted a jukebox by Goodman for his contribution). In the second verse of the tune, Coe namechecks \u2013 and does some pretty spot-on imitations of \u2013 Waylon Jennings, Charley Pride and Merle Haggard.

Coe faces up to three years in prison. The nearly half a million dollars owed includes taxes, interest and penalties. \n \n According to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office, instead of paying the taxes in full, Coe spent the money earned from live concert performances \"on other debts and gambling.\" \n \n The case is in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. Court documents say Coe received multiple MoneyGram transfers of income in Cincinnati in 2011 and 2012. He also used a Cincinnati-based accounting firm to prepare his taxes, and in 2009 filed his taxes from Cincinnati. \n \n His Memphis-based attorney, Michael Stengel, could not be reached for comment. \n \n Coe, who performs at least 100 times a year, arranged to be paid primarily in cash, the news release said. Coe didn't allow $50 bills, the news release said, because \"he believed they were bad luck and would not gamble with them.\" \n \n He stopped using a personal bank account in 2009. \n \n \"Coe's arrangement to be paid primarily in cash was also in an effort to impede the ability of the IRS to collect on the taxes owed,\" the news release said. \n \n The case was investigated by the U.S. Attorney's Office and special agents with the IRS's criminal investigations unit. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1FadW1Y\n", "completion": "Well, this is about what you'd expect from the guy who wrote the song \"Take This Job and Shove It\": David Allan Coe owes the IRS more than $466,000 in back taxes.

Cofounder and CEO Mike McCue tells us that before launching Flipboard, he made his engineers hook up double the amount of servers they thought would be necessary.

Since then, Mike says \"a significant percentage of the iPad population\" has already downloaded the app. \n \n We sat with Mike for an extended interview, which we've published below. We covered what it was like during the app's crazy first days, why Mike raised so much money so early, and what it's like working with Apple and Kleiner Perkins. \n \n The most interesting thing we learned is how Flipboard plans to make money. Flipboard plans to actually show more of publishers' content, advertising against it, and then share revenues. Mike says it will increase publishers' digital revenues \"by a factor of ten from what they're currently doing with banner ads.\" \n \n Here are some more highlights: \n \n Is Flipboard stealing content?

Flipboard, on the other hand, is a new type of digital publication for the iPad that wants to meld your news and social worlds into a sort of personalized magazine. \n \n Flipboard collects news, Twitter updates, and Facebook posts into a unique, animated magazine-style layout. Some preset news feeds and a Twitter \"daily photo\" stream introduce you to the concept, and you are prompted to add your Twitter and Facebook credentials so you stay on top of your own social networks and share interesting things you find with your friends. \n \n You can also choose from a handful of built-in news sources like the Wall Street Journal and GigaOM's tech blogs. Flipboard displays sources as tiles on a magazine-like table of contents page. When you tap a source, fluid animations will roll out stories, headlines, and photos across the page to remind you that this is most certainly not your grandparent's magazine. \n \n If you run to try out Flipboard right away Wednesday morning, you should know that quite a lot of buzz is swirling around it, so some features may stutter or hang. This is an unfortunate reality of Web services that get temporarily overwhelmed, but things should settle down soon. \n \n Flipboard is available for free now in the App Store and requires an iPad running iOS 3.2 or later. \n\n\nArticle:  Magazines aren't dead; they're just getting reinvented. Flipboard turns Facebook and Twitter feeds into attractive, magazine-style pages for beach-friendly consumption. \n \n Facebook and Twitter feeds have never looked better than with Flipboard for iPad.

(Shades of Sobees, which works a similar kind of magic--though only for Facebook.) \n \n \n \n Flipboard also delivers your choice of a couple dozen aggregated content sections (news, finance, music, tech, etc.) selected by Flipboard's creators.

Swipe to flip to the next page, or tap a story to read it--an abbreviated version of it, anyway. As with Blogshelf, you often have to \"tap through\" to the original Web page to access the full content. \n \n \n \n I can live with that, but Flipboard needs to fix a few other areas. For starters, you're currently limited to just nine sections. Choosing a new one means deleting something else--and the Facebook and Twitter sections can't be removed, even if you're not a social-media maven. \n \n There's no offline option, either, so if you're not currently connected via Wi-Fi or 3G, no soup for you. \n \n The biggest wrinkle?

What that means, per the Detroit Free Press: Berkowitz says car shoppers' No. 1 gripe is the lack of a clear, exact car price; Price Promise cuts out the haggling that follows as a result by allowing dealers to email the exact price of a vehicle found on the site to shoppers who request it. Shoppers can then print out a certificate bearing the number; the dealer must sell the car for that price. Ergo, no haggling.

That includes any attempt to sit or kneel, as dozens of players have done during the past two seasons to protest racial inequality and police brutality. Those teams also will have the option to fine any team personnel, including players, for the infraction. \n \n \"We want people to be respectful of the national anthem,\" commissioner Roger Goodell said. \"We want people to stand -- that's all personnel -- and make sure they treat this moment in a respectful fashion.

Some conservative Republicans joined in rejecting the measure. \n \n The House, in the wee hours of Friday morning, had passed its latest version of a stopgap spending bill after rejecting on Wednesday a nearly identical version of the legislation, which is needed to keep the government open after Sept. 30 and to provide assistance to victims of natural disasters. The House vote was 219 to 203. \n \n House Republican leaders, trying to recover from a humiliating political defeat, had made one change in the bill -- but it was one that most Democrats in the House and Senate opposed, trimming green energy loans.

At the age of 7, Dylan told her mother, actress Mia Farrow, that Allen had molested her. \n \n Allen has always denied the allegations and has never been charged with a crime. Dylan Farrow has stood by her story for more than two decades. She first went public with her accusations in 2014 with an open letter in the New York Times. \n \n Below is Allen's full response to \"CBS This Morning\": \n \n \"When this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State Child Welfare. They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place. Instead, they found it likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup. \n \n Dylan's older brother Moses has said that he witnessed their mother doing exactly that \u2013 relentlessly coaching Dylan, trying to drum into her that her father was a dangerous sexual predator.

In the days since the piece was published, Mira Sorvino and Greta Gerwig expressed regret for working with Allen. Rebecca Hall and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet said they would donate their salaries from working on Allen\u2019s films to anti-sexual violence organizations. \n \n Not everyone who has worked with Allen has condemned him.

{"prompt": "What are the key points across these news articles:\n\n\nArticle: People typically rush into marriage, not divorces. But a curious change in the GOP\u2019s tax bill means that some couples \u2014 or individuals \u2014 might rush back to the courthouse. \n \n The GOP tax bill signed by Trump late last year fundamentally altered many aspects of the tax code, sending accountants scrambling, and stands as the biggest change to the tax system since 1986. Despite long-standing calls to address the federal debt, the tax cuts outlined in the bill came out to be pricey, projected to cost $1.5 trillion or more, with insufficient revenue gains to pay for it. \n \n One way the Republican bill writers tried to raise revenue to compensate for the cuts was through alimony. Under the new bill, alimony paid by one spouse to the other will not be tax deductible, and the spouse receiving the alimony no longer has to pay taxes on it. In the current system, it works the opposite way, with the payer deducting the full amount and the recipient paying taxes on the alimony at a rate of 15%. The new rule means the government will end up with more of a divorcing pair\u2019s combined money. \n \n When news dropped that this might be included in the bill in November, things got crazy. \n \n \u201cWhen everyone thought the deduction deadline was going to be Dec. 31, we had a rush of clients,\u201d said Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. \u201cAll of a sudden we had clients who were going to be receiving alimony demanding we get them divorced immediately.\u201d \n \n Ultimately the law won\u2019t take effect until next year, giving divorcing couples a reprieve. But the law does set up 2018 to potentially be a wild year for divorces. \n \n \u201cUnder the new tax bill, things are going to change somewhat drastically and it\u2019s difficult to predict how it\u2019s going to affect parties,\u201d Sheera Gefen, a divorce attorney in New York, told Yahoo Finance. \n \n It almost sounds like the plot of a Coen brothers movie. In some states, the alimony-seeking spouse may have significant incentive to delay the divorce settlement in...\n\n\nArticle:  Figuring out alimony has always been difficult for divorce lawyers, mediators and couples trying not to be couples. \n \n Thanks to the new tax code, it's even tougher. \n \n In previous years, the pain of alimony stemmed in large part from each state having its own set of rules. These determined how much alimony payments should be and when such payments should end. \n \n \"There's not really a cohesive rationale for alimony,\" said Mary Kay Kisthardt, a professor of law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law. \"In any given state, we're not sure what we're trying to do.\" \n \n For the last 75 years, however, one rule was clear: Alimony was deductible for the payer, and the recipient paid income tax on it. \n \n The new code delivers a disruption to those who work in divorce \u2014 and those who go through it, experts say, by upending this constant in a highly subjective legal arena. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in all divorces after Dec. 31, 2018, alimony will no longer be deductible for the payer, and taxes don't need to be paid on it by the recipient. \n \n Lawyers are scrambling to understand and react. \n\n\nArticle:  Republicans may pride themselves on upholding family values, but their new tax law could soon lead to a surge in married couples calling it quits. \n \n Lawyers are counseling couples considering divorce to do it this year \u2014 before a 76-year-old deduction for alimony payments is wiped out in 2019 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to wait,\u201d said Mary Vidas, a lawyer in Philadelphia and former chair of the American Bar Association\u2019s section on family law. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a divorce, get it now.\u201d \n \n Potential divorcees have all of 2018 to use the alimony deduction as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with estranged spouses. \n \n The deduction substantially reduces the cost of alimony payments \u2014 for people in the highest income-tax bracket, it means every dollar they pay to support a former spouse really costs them a little more than 60 cents. \n \n The change is an example of how the tax law is having far-reaching consequences beyond its corporate and individual tax cuts, in some cases by quietly overturning decades of tax policy. \n \n Morning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

People won\u2019t be willing to pay as much, they say, which will disproportionately hurt women who tend to earn less and are more likely to be on the receiving end of alimony payments. (Child support payments are not deductible.) \n \n \u201cThe repeal reduces the bargaining power of vulnerable spouses, mostly women, in achieving financial stability after a divorce,\u201d said Brian Vertz, a family law attorney in Pittsburgh. \n \n Projected to raise $6.9 billion over the next decade, the repeal is one of the ways Republicans defrayed the cost of their tax rewrite. \n \n A spokesman for House Ways...\n", "completion": "An alimony deduction to be erased in 2019 under the new tax plan has lawyers preparing for a wave of divorces this year\u2014and eying complications for recipients beyond. Payers have long received a tax break on alimony, while recipients have paid income tax on payments. But after Dec. 31, 2018, alimony will no longer be deductible for the payer, and recipients won't need to pay income tax on it, reports Politico. While this will help recipients\u2014primarily women\u2014in one sense, they'll suffer in other ways. As lawyer Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich tells Yahoo, a man in the highest income-tax bracket who pays his wife $100,000 in alimony in 2018 ($85,000 for the woman after taxes) actually pays about $60,000 with the deduction. Without it, he might argue $60,000 is all he can afford to pay, leaving the wife with $25,000 less than before. Attorneys predict the change will complicate divorce negotiations and lead to more cases being heard in court. But some say women will be disproportionally injured by it. \"The repeal reduces the bargaining power of vulnerable spouses, mostly women, in achieving financial stability after a divorce,\" a lawyer tells Politico. Others point out alimony recipients may have a harder time saving for retirement as contributions to retirement accounts often have to come from taxed income, per CNBC. Marzano-Lesnevich says her firm has already had \"a rush of clients \u2026 demanding we get them divorced immediately\" to avoid such complications in 2019. More couples are expected to follow suit this year.

The government-approved software that powers such machines gives the house a fixed mathematical edge, so that casinos can be certain of how much they\u2019ll earn over the long haul\u2014say, 7.129 cents for every dollar played. But on June 2 and 3, a number of Lumiere\u2019s machines had spit out far more money than they\u2019d consumed, despite not awarding any major jackpots, an aberration known in industry parlance as a negative hold. Since code isn\u2019t prone to sudden fits of madness, the only plausible explanation was that someone was cheating. \n \n Casino security pulled up the surveillance tapes and eventually spotted the culprit, a black-haired man in his thirties who wore a Polo zip-up and carried a square brown purse. Unlike most slots cheats, he didn\u2019t appear to tinker with any of the machines he targeted, all of which were older models manufactured by Aristocrat Leisure of Australia. Instead he\u2019d simply play, pushing the buttons on a game like Star Drifter or Pelican Pete while furtively holding his iPhone close to the screen. \n \n He\u2019d walk away after a few minutes, then return a bit later to give the game a second chance. That's when he'd get lucky. The man would parlay a $20 to $60 investment into as much as $1,300 before cashing out and moving on to another machine, where he\u2019d start the cycle anew. Over the course of two days, his winnings tallied just over $21,000. The only odd thing about his behavior during his streaks was the way he\u2019d hover his finger above the Spin button for long stretches before finally jabbing it in haste; typical slots players don't pause between spins like that. \n \n On June 9, Lumiere Place shared its findings with the Missouri Gaming Commission, which in turn issued a statewide alert.

But this wasn't just a random scammer who'd figured out how to play the machine: It was part of an elaborate Russian hacking scheme Brendan Koerner explores for Wired. That patron, Murat Bliev, was a member of a St. Petersburg cheat group, a willing participant in what Koerner describes as a \"hotbed of slots-related malfeasance.\" This underground movement originated in 2009, when then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to make most gambling illegal to curb organized crime. All of the slot machines in Russian casinos had to go somewhere, and so many of them ended up with high bidders (including Bliev's organization), who then poked around in the machines' coding to figure out how to exploit them. How the racket-runners worked: They figured out the patterns behind the machines' pseudorandom number generators, or PRNGs, which, while difficult to crack, aren't impossible if someone can get into the machine's insides. But because the \"temporal state\" of each machine is different, additional surveillance steps were needed in combination with the PRNG intel\u2014and a casino security expert figured out how the hackers pulled it off. The scheme involved cellphones with video, a tech team back in St. Petersburg, and vibrating \"timing markers\" sent to the players to indicate when to hit. While Bliev and others were eventually busted, the hacking still lives on via enhanced methods, as there's \"no easy technical fix. \"A finger that lingers too long above a spin button may be a guard's only clue,\" Koerner writes.

Alongside these general regularities, we describe interlanguage variations in the emotional spectrum of languages that allow us to rank corpora. We also show how our word evaluations can be used to construct physical-like instruments for both real-time and offline measurement of the emotional content of large-scale texts. \n\n\nArticle:  Jakub Halun, Wikimedia Commons \n \n Human language is biased toward being happy, finds a new study that identifies 10 of the world\u2019s most upbeat languages. \n \n The study, published in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, supports the Pollyanna Hypothesis, which holds that there is a universal human tendency to use positive words more frequently than negative ones. Nevertheless, the findings determined that some languages tend to skew happier than others. \n \n Lead author Peter Sheridan Dodds of the University of Vermont\u2019s Computational Story Lab and his team found the top 100,000 of the most frequently used words across 10 languages. The researchers then asked native speakers of the various languages to rate whether the words were \u201chappy\u201d or \u201csad\u201d on a 1\u20139 scale.

The brother, whose name is Syed Raheel Farook, was falsely identified as the gunman by some media outlets because the names are so similar, but he is, in fact, a decorated Navy veteran, BuzzFeed reports. The brother joined up in August 2003 and left the service in August 2007, and Navy records state that he received the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon during his service, which included time as an information systems technician on the USS Enterprise. A Navy spokesman tells the New York Daily News that Farook was a computer technician who also received an award for good conduct. Investigators are still trying to piece together a motive for the rampage the other Syed R. Farook allegedly carried out with wife Tashfeen Malik. A \"veritable armory,\" including at least a dozen pipe bombs, was found at their home, and officials say they're probing possible links to Islamic extremists but haven't found firm evidence of radicalization, the Los Angeles Times reports. Associates, including colleagues who survived the massacre, say they simply don't understand how the man they knew could have done this. \"This was a person who was successful, who had a good job, a good income, a wife, and a family. What was he missing in his life?\" a man who worshiped with him at a mosque in San Bernardino tells the AP.<|endoftext|>"}
