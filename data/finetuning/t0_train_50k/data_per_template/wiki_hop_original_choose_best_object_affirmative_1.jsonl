{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.\n\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \"Pinax theatri botanici\" (English, \"Illustrated exposition of plants\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\n\n- The skull is a bony structure that forms the head of the skeleton in most vertebrates. It supports the structures of the face and provides a protective cavity for the brain. The skull is composed of two parts: the cranium and the mandible. In the human these two parts are the neurocranium and the viscerocranium or facial skeleton that includes the mandible as its largest bone. The skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of cephalisationhousing the brain, and several sensory structures such as the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. In the human these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton.\n\n- Herpetology (from Greek \"\"herpein\"\" meaning \"to creep\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone.\n\n- Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \"peaks on the back\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.\n\n- Diapsids (\"two arches\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).\n\n- The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \"Carboniferous\" means \"coal-bearing\" and derives from the Latin words \"carb\" (\"coal\") and \"fer\" (\"I bear, I carry\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.\n\n- Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \"Tomistoma\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \"Tomistoma\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.\n\n- The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \"four-footed\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.\n\n- A genus (\u00a0genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\n\n- Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.\n\n- Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.\n\n- Proaigialosaurus is an extinct genus of semi-aquatic diapsid reptile . The genus was erected by Kuhn ( 1958 ) , based upon skull fragments , which have since been lost . Generally considered the oldest specimen of the lizard family Aigialosauridae , others have considered it to be a pleurosaurid , a marine sphenodontian ( the order to which the extant Tuatara belongs ) . Proaigialosaurus was discovered in the Solnhofen limestone formation of Bavaria , Germany . It was small ( less than a metre long ) .\n\n- Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.\n\n- Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.\n\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\n\n- Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \"Bipes\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals.\n\n- The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'proaigialosaurus'.\n\nChoices:\n- alligatoridae\n - amphibia\n - amphisbaenia\n - animal\n - bipes\n - crocodile\n - crocodilia\n - diapsid\n - dibamidae\n - dinosaur\n - gavialidae\n - gymnophiona\n - homo\n - human\n - lepidosauria\n - lissamphibia\n - lizard\n - modern birds\n - mya\n - reptile\n - rhynchocephalia\n - tetrapoda\n - tomistoma\n - toxicofera\n", "completion": "lepidosauria<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Mekosuchinae was a subfamily of crocodiles from Australia and the South Pacific that have now become extinct.

There is however disagreement on whether or not Mekosuchinae is a subfamily within Crocodylidae, or a distinct family, Mekosuchidae, on its own within the superfamily Crocodyloidea.\n\n- Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Wu (222280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). It previously existed from 220222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan, declared himself 'Emperor'. Its name was derived from the place it was based in  the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as \"Wu\". It was referred to as \"Eastern Wu\" or \"Sun Wu\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called \"Eastern Wu\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \"Sun Wu\" because the family name of its rulers was \"Sun\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei).\n\n- Cao Huan (246-303), courtesy name Jingming, was the fifth and last emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. In 265, he abdicated the throne in favour of Sima Yan (later Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty), and brought an end to the Wei regime. After his abdication, Cao Huan was granted the title \"Prince of Chenliu\" and held it until his death, after which he was posthumously honoured as \"Emperor Yuan (of Cao Wei)\".\n\n- The Yellow Turban Rebellion, also translated as the Yellow Scarves Rebellion, was a peasant revolt in China against the Han dynasty. The uprising broke out in the year 184 during the reign of Emperor Ling. It took 21 years until the uprising was suppressed in the year 205. The rebellion, which got its name from the color of the cloths that the rebels wore on their heads, marked an important point in the history of Taoism due to the rebels' association with secret Taoist societies. The revolt was also used as the opening event in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\".\n\n- Japan (\"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" ; formally \"\" or \"Nihon-koku\", means \"State of Japan\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. \n\n- The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors.\n\n- Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces and acts in the upward direction at the centre of mass of the displaced fluid. Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse.\n\n- Cao Chong ( 196 -- 208 ) , courtesy name Cangshu , was a son of Cao Cao , a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han dynasty and laid the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period . A child prodigy , Cao Chong is best known for his ingenious method of weighing an elephant using the principle of buoyancy . He was considered by his father as a possible successor but died prematurely at the age of 12 .\n\n- Sun Quan (182252), courtesy name Zhongmou, formally known as Emperor Da of Wu (lit. \"Great Emperor of Wu\"), was the founder of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He inherited control of the warlord state founded by his elder brother Sun Ce in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as \"King of Wu\" and from 229 to 252 as the \"Emperor of Wu\". Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Quan governed his empire mostly separate of politics and ideology, he is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he accommodated the wills of both his rivals but only when it benefited his state of Wu and never fully attempted to conquer his rivals, although most of historians would cite his lack of logistical resources to do so.\n\n- Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC  June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202  195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class.\n\n- The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states.\n\n- Cao Pi (187  29 June 226), courtesy name Zihuan, was the first emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. He was born in Qiao (; present-day Bozhou, Anhui) as the second son of Cao Cao, a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. However, he was the eldest son among all the children born to Cao Cao by his concubine (later wife) Lady Bian. Of all his brothers, Cao Pi was the shrewdest. Instead of focusing on academic studies or administering military affairs, he was always in the presence of court officials in order to gain their support. He was mostly in charge of defence at the start of his career. After the defeat of Cao Cao's rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he took the widow of Yuan Shao's son Yuan Xi, Lady Zhen, as a concubine, but in 221 Lady Zhen died and Guo N\u00fcwang became empress.\n\n- In psychology research literature, the term child prodigy is defined as a person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert performer. Child prodigies are rare; and, in some domains, there are no child prodigies at all. Prodigiousness in childhood does not always predict adult eminence.\n\n- Archimedes of Syracuse  was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola.\n\n- Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \"Shu\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \"Han\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \"Shu\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \"Han\" states throughout Chinese history.\n\n- The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \"Three Kingdoms\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.\n\n- In science, buoyancy (or ; also known as upthrust) is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the displaced fluid.\n\n- Dong Zhuo (died 22 May 192), courtesy name Zhongying, was a politician and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He seized control of the capital Luoyang in 189 when it was in a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling and a clash between the eunuch faction and some court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Emperor Shao and instated Emperor Xian.\n\n- The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.\n\n- In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.\n\n- Wang Mang (c. 45  6 October 23\u00a0AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \"renewed\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.\n\n- Cao Rui (204 or 206  22 January 239), courtesy name Yuanzhong, was the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. His parentage is in dispute: his mother, Lady Zhen, was Yuan Xi's wife, but she later remarried Cao Pi, the first ruler of Wei. Based on conflicting accounts of his age, Pei Songzhi calculated that, in order to be Cao Pi's son, Cao Rui could not have been 36 (by East Asian age reckoning) when he died as recorded, so the recorded age was in error; Lu Bi and Mou Guangsheng argued instead that Cao Rui was Yuan Xi's son.\n\n- The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.\n\n- Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \"Wei\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \"Cao\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \"Wei\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.\n\n- A courtesy name (\"zi\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.\n\n- The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\".\nIt was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220\u00a0AD).\n\n- Cao Cao (155\u00a0 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \"Emperor Wu of Wei\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.\n\n- Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976.\n\n- Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\n\n- Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\") and South Korea (officially the \"Republic of Korea\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.\n\n- China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381\u00a0billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\n\n- The end of the Han dynasty refers to the period of Chinese history from 189 to 220 AD, which roughly coincides with the tumultuous reign of the Han dynasty's last ruler, Emperor Xian. During this period, the country was thrown into turmoil by the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184-205). Meanwhile, the Han Empire's institutions were destroyed by the warlord Dong Zhuo, and fractured into regional regimes ruled by various warlords, some of whom were nobles and officials of the Han imperial court. Eventually, one of those warlords, Cao Cao, was able to gradually reunify the empire, ostensibly under Emperor Xian's rule, but the empire was actually controlled by Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao's efforts to completely reunite the Han empire were rebuffed at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 / 209, when his armies were defeated by the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao's son and heir, Cao Pi, pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour. Cao Pi became the emperor of a new state, Cao Wei. A year later, in response to Cao Pi's usurpation of the Han throne, Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han; and in 229, Sun Quan followed suit, declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu. The period from Emperor Xian's abdication in 220 to the partial reunification of China under the Jin dynasty in 265 was known as the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.\n\n- FLUID (Fast Light User Interface Designer) is a graphical editor and GUI builder that is used to produce FLTK source code. FLUID edits and saves its state in text .fl files, which can be edited in a text editor for finer control over display and behavior.\n\n- Liu Bei (161  10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu.\n\n- Sima Yi (179  7 September 251), courtesy name Zhongda, was a general and politician of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. He is perhaps best known for defending Wei from Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions. His success and subsequent rise in prominence paved the way for his grandson Sima Yan's founding of the Jin dynasty, which would eventually bring an end to the Three Kingdoms era. In 265 after the Jin dynasty was established, Sima Yi was posthumously honoured as Emperor Xuan of Jin with the temple name of Gaozu.\n\n- In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \"W\", is the product of the mass\u00a0\"m\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration\u00a0\"g\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'cao chong'.\n\nChoices:\n- academic\n - builder\n - chancellor\n - classics\n - confucian scholar\n - designer\n - duke\n - emperor\n - engineer\n - engineering\n - father\n - founder\n - general\n - king\n - leader\n - major\n - mathematician\n - military\n - official\n - peasant\n - physicist\n - physics\n - politician\n - prior\n - rebel\n - research\n - ruler\n - science\n - script\n - social reformer\n - socialist\n - sovereign\n - taiwan\n", "completion": "physicist<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- A province is almost always an administrative division, within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman \"provincia\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \"outside the capital city\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.\n\n- Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms.\n\n- A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate.

In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed. In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD).\n\n- Kolkata (, also known as Calcutta , the official name until 2001) is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal.

Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the southwest.\n\n- A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.\n\n- Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns).

It has a population of about 25 million, making it the second most populous city after Mumbai and most populous urban agglomeration in India and 3 largest urban area in the world. Urban expansion in Delhi has caused it to grow beyond the NCT to incorporate towns in neighbouring states. At its largest extent, there is a population of about 25 million residents . According to data released by Oxford Economics, Delhi NCR urban agglomeration has replaced Mumbai Metropolitan Region urban agglomeration as the economic capital of India. However the comparison of the figures specific to the Metropolis of Delhi and Metropolis of Mumbai was not provided by this institution. These figures however did not match with those revealed by the reserve bank of India, The economic survey of India, The economic survey of Delhi and Maharashtra.\n\n- The interdisciplinarity field of materials science, also commonly termed materials science and engineering, involves the discovery and design of new materials, with an emphasis on solids. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study. \nMany of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available. Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.\n\n- An academic degree is a qualification awarded on successful completion of a course of study in higher education, normally at a college or university. These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, typically including bachelor's, masters and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates, and professional degrees.

This was related to one-act or two-act short operas that were otherwise commercially hard to stage alone. A prominent example is the double-bill of \"Pagliacci\" with \"Cavalleria rusticana\" first staged on 22 December 1893 by the Met. The two operas have since been frequently performed as a double-bill, a pairing referred to in the operatic world colloquially as \"Cav and Pag\". \n\n- James Harvey Nicholson (September 14, 1916  December 10, 1972) was an American film producer.

Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \"Evil Dead\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film.\n\n- Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'carol speed'.\n\nChoices:\n- actor\n - author\n - bassist\n - book\n - detective\n - diversity\n - drummer\n - editor\n - founder\n - game\n - literary\n - major\n - manager\n - opera\n - personal assistant\n - producer\n - publicist\n - r\n - sales\n - science\n - writer\n", "completion": "actor<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- A knot is a method of fastening or securing linear material such as rope by tying or interweaving. It may consist of a length of one or several segments of rope, string, webbing, twine, strap, or even chain interwoven such that the line can bind to itself or to some other object (the \"load\"). Knots have been the subject of interest for their ancient origins, their common uses, and the area of mathematics known as knot theory.\n\n- The clove hitch is a type of knot. Along with the bowline and the sheet bend, it is often considered one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double Hitch. A clove hitch is two successive half-hitches around an object. It is most effectively used as a crossing knot. It can be used as a binding knot, but is not particularly secure in that role. A clove hitch made around the rope's own standing part is known as either two half-hitches or buntline hitch, depending on whether the turns of the clove hitch progress away from or towards the hitched object.\n\n- The sheet bend (also known as becket bend, weaver's knot and weaver's hitch) is a bend, that is, a knot that joins two ropes together. Doubled, it is effective in binding lines of different diameter or rigidity securely together, although it has a tendency to work loose when not under load.\n\n- The bowline (or ) is an ancient and simple knot used to form a fixed loop at the end of a rope. It has the virtues of being both easy to tie and untie; most notably, it is easy to untie after being subjected to a load. The bowline is sometimes referred as \"King of the knots\" because of its importance. It is one of the four basic maritime knots (the other three are figure-eight knot, reef knot and clove hitch).\n\n- The two half-hitches is a type of knot, specifically a binding knot or hitch knot. It consists of an overhand knot tied around a post, followed by a half-hitch. Equivalently, it consists of a half-turn around a post followed by a clove hitch of the running end around the standing part.\n\n- The buntline hitch is a knot used for attaching a rope to an object. It is formed by passing the working end around an object, then making a clove hitch around the rope's standing part, taking care that the turns of the clove hitch progress \"towards\" the object rather than away from it. Secure and easily tied, the buntline hitch will jam when subjected to extreme loads. Given the knot's propensity to jam, it is often made in slipped form.\n\n- The snuggle hitch is a modification of the clove hitch , and is stronger and more secure . Owen K. Nuttall of the International Guild of Knot Tyers came up with this unique hitch , and it was first documented in the Guild 's Knotting Matters magazine issue of January , 1987 . Generally , hitches are used to attach a line to another rope or spar , pole , etc. , and are usually temporary .

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\n\n- The historical mystery or historical whodunit is a subgenre of two literary genres, historical fiction and mystery fiction. These works are set in a time period considered historical from the author's perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit Ellis Peters's \"Cadfael Chronicles\" (1977-1994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery. The increasing popularity and prevalence of this type of fiction in subsequent decades has spawned a distinct subgenre recognized by the publishing industry and libraries. \"Publishers Weekly\" noted in 2010 of the genre, \"The past decade has seen an explosion in both quantity and quality. Never before have so many historical mysteries been published, by so many gifted writers, and covering such a wide range of times and places.\" Editor Keith Kahla concurs, \"From a small group of writers with a very specialized audience, the historical mystery has become a critically acclaimed, award-winning genre with a toehold on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\"\n\n- The guqin is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family. It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement, as highlighted by the quote \"a gentleman does not part with his \"qin\" or \"se\" without good reason,\" as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius. It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as \"the father of Chinese music\" or \"the instrument of the sages\". The \"guqin\" is not to be confused with the \"guzheng\", another Chinese long zither also without frets, but with moveable bridges under each string.\n\n- The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\".\nIt was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220\u00a0AD).\n\n- Mystery fiction is a genre of fiction usually involving a mysterious death or a crime to be solved. In a closed circle of suspects, each suspect must have a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime. The central character must be a detective who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts fairly presented to the reader. Sometimes mystery books are nonfictional. \"Mystery fiction\" can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit. Mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled detective stories, which focus on action and gritty realism.\n\n- Robert Hans van Gulik (August 9, 1910  September 24, 1967) was an orientalist, diplomat, musician (of the guqin), and writer, best known for the Judge Dee historical mysteries, the protagonist of which he borrowed from the 18th-century Chinese detective novel \"Dee Goong An\".\n\n- Publishers Weekly (PW) is an American weekly trade news magazine targeted at publishers, librarians, booksellers and literary agents.

Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters.

Like its predecessor , The Chinese Maze Murders it was intended for a Japanese or Chinese audience but he later choose to publish it in English . The Chinese Lake Murder was written at roughly the same time as The Chinese Bell Murders but remained unpublished for some years .\n\n- Historical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past. Historical fiction can be an ambiguous term: frequently it is used as a synonym for describing the historical novel; however, the term can be applied to works in other narrative formats, such as those in the performing and visual arts like theatre, opera, cinema, television, comics, and graphic novels.\n\n- Judge Dee (also, Judge Di) is a semi-fictional character based on the historical figure Di Renjie, county magistrate and statesman of the Tang court. The character appeared in the 18th-century Chinese detective and \"gong'an\" crime novel \"Di Gong An\". After Robert van Gulik came across it in an antiquarian book store in Tokyo, he translated the novel into English and then used the style and characters to write his own original Judge Dee historical mystery stories.\n\n- The term magistrate is used in a variety of systems of governments and laws to refer to a civilian officer who administers the law. In ancient Rome, a \"magistratus\" was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both judicial and executive powers. In other parts of the world, such as China, a magistrate was responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales), magistrates may be volunteers without formal legal training who perform a judicial role with regard to minor matters.\n\n- The Tang dynasty was an imperial dynasty of China preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It is generally regarded as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Its territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty, and the Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was the most populous city in the world.\n\n- Jurisdiction (from the Latin \"ius, \" meaning \"law\" and \"\" meaning \"to speak\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.\n\n- Chang'an is an ancient capital of more than ten dynasties in Chinese history, today known as Xi'an. Chang'an means \"Perpetual Peace\" in Classical Chinese. During the short-lived Xin dynasty, the city was renamed \"Constant Peace\"; yet after its fall in AD 23, the old name was restored. By the time of the Ming dynasty, the name was again changed to Xi'an, meaning \"Western Peace\", which has remained its name to the present day.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'genre' with the subject 'the chinese lake murders'.\n\nChoices:\n- book\n - crime novel\n - culture\n - detective\n - detective novel\n - family\n - government\n - hardboiled\n - historical fiction\n - historical mysteries\n - historical novel\n - history\n - japanese\n - law\n - literary genre\n - music\n - musical\n - mystery\n - mystery fiction\n - narrative\n - news magazine\n - novel\n - opera\n - prose\n - television\n - variety\n - visual arts\n", "completion": "crime novel<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- A wiki is a website that provides collaborative modification of its content and structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language (known as \"wiki markup\") and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor. A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may also be imposed to organize content. A wiki engine is a type of content management system, but it differs from most other such systems, including blog software, in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.\n\n- PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.

Similar to other web languages like PHP , ASP , JSP and template systems like eRuby , Haml also embeds some code that gets executed during runtime and generates HTML code in order to provide some dynamic content . In order to run Haml code , files need to have . haml extension . These files are similar to . erb or eRuby files which also help to embed Ruby code while developing a web application . While parsing coding comments Haml uses the same rules as Ruby 1.9 or later . Haml understands only ASCII compatible encodings like UTF - 8 but does not understand UTF - 16 or UTF - 32 , since these are not compatible with ASCII . Haml can be used in command line , as a separate Ruby module or can be used in a Ruby on Rails application making Haml suitable for a wide range of applications .\n\n- Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License.

The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.\n\n- A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \"run\" in some parts of the United States, \"burn\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \"beck\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.\n\n- An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration).

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \"emperor\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \"Augustus\" or \"Caesar\". Another title often used was \"imperator\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \"princeps\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \"Princeps Senatus\", \"Consul\" and \"Pontifex Maximus\".\n\n- Raffaele Sansoni Galeoti Riario ( May 3 , 1461 -- July 9 , 1521 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Renaissance , mainly known as the constructor of the Palazzo della Cancelleria and the person who invited Michelangelo to Rome .

Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.\n\n- Rione (plural: \"rioni\") is the name given to a neighbourhood in several Italian cities.

Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes.\n\n- The Palazzo della Cancelleria (Italian for \"Palace of the Chancellery\", meaning the Papal Chancellery) is a Renaissance palace in Rome, Italy, situated between the present Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and the Campo de' Fiori, in the rione of Parione. It was built between 14891513 by Donato Bramante (14441514) as a palace for Cardinal Raffaele Riario, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, and is regarded as the earliest Renaissance palace in Rome.

He introduced Renaissance architecture to Milan and the High Renaissance style to Rome, where his plan for St. Peter's Basilica formed the basis of design executed by Michelangelo. His Tempietto (San Pietro in Montorio) marked the beginning of the High Renaissance in Rome (1502) when Pope Julius II appointed him to build a sanctuary over the spot where Peter was allegedly crucified.\nLife.\nUrbino.\nBramante was born under the name Donato d'Augnolo, Donato di Pascuccio d'Antonio, or Donato Pascuccio d'Antonio in Fermignano near Urbino. Here, in 1467, Luciano Laurana was adding to the Palazzo Ducale an arcaded courtyard and other Renaissance features to Federico da Montefeltro's ducal palace. Bramante's architecture has eclipsed his painting skills: he knew the painters Melozzo da Forl\u00ec and Piero della Francesca well, who were interested in the rules of perspective and illusionistic features in Mantegna's painting. \n\n- Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475  18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n- Pope Paul VI, born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini (26 September 1897  6 August 1978), reigned as Pope from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978. Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.\n\n- In art history, High Renaissance is the period denoting the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardo's fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the \"High Style\" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.\n\n- The Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church is an office of the Papal household that administrates the property and revenues of the Holy See. Formerly, his responsibilities included the fiscal administration of the Patrimony of St. Peter.

His heraldic arms are ornamented with two keysone gold, one silverin saltire surmounted by an ombrellino, a canopy or umbrella of alternating red and yellow stripes. These are also the arms of the Holy See during a Papal interregnum.\n\n- Raffaele Sansoni Galeoti Riario (3 May 1461  9 July 1521) was an Italian Cardinal of the Renaissance, mainly known as the constructor of the Palazzo della Cancelleria and the person who invited Michelangelo to Rome.

Other prominent leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL).\n\n- The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \"de facto\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \"de jure\" NHL championship prize in 1947.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'ron schock'.\n\nChoices:\n- accounting\n - canada\n - canadian football\n - entertainment\n - fashion\n - game\n - governor\n - ice hockey player\n - major\n - member\n", "completion": "ice hockey player<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , \"Apolln\"; Doric: , \"Apelln\"; Arcadocypriot: , \"Apeiln\"; Aeolic: , \"Aploun\") is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the \"kouros\" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \"Apulu\".\n\n- In ancient Greek religion and Greek mythology, Demeter (Attic: \"Dmtr\"; Doric: \"Dmtr\") is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth. Her cult titles include Sito, \"she of the Grain\", as the giver of food or grain, and Thesmophoros (\"thesmos\": divine order, unwritten law \"phoros\": bringer, bearer), \"Law-Bringer,\" as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society.\n\n- Hecate or Hekate (Greek ) is a goddess in Ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding two torches or a key and in later periods depicted in triple form. She was variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, light, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, necromancy, and sorcery. She appears in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter and in Hesiod's \"Theogony\", where she is promoted strongly as a great goddess. The place of origin of her following is uncertain, but it is thought that she had popular followings in Thrace. She was one of the main deities worshiped in Athenian households as a protective goddess and one who bestowed prosperity and daily blessings on the family.\nIn the post-Christian writings of the Chaldean Oracles (2nd3rd century CE) she was regarded with (some) rulership over earth, sea and sky, as well as a more universal role as Saviour (Soteira), Mother of Angels and the Cosmic World Soul. \nRegarding the nature of her cult, it has been remarked, \"she is more at home on the fringes than in the center of Greek polytheism. Intrinsically ambivalent and polymorphous, she straddles conventional boundaries and eludes definition.\"\n\n- In Norse mythology, Thor (from Old Norse \u00de\u00f3rr) is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. The cognate deity in wider Germanic mythology and paganism was known in Old English as \u00deunor and in Old High German as Donar (runic \u00feonar ), stemming from a Common Germanic *\u00deunraz (meaning \"thunder\").\n\n- In Greek mythology, Crius , Kreios or Krios () was one of the Titans in the list given in Hesiod's \"Theogony\", a son of Uranus and Gaia. The least individualized among the Titans he was overthrown in the Titanomachy. M. L. West has suggested how Hesiod filled out the complement of Titans from the core groupadding three figures from the archaic tradition of Delphi, Coeus, and Phoibe, whose name Apollo assumed with the oracle, and Themis. Among possible further interpolations among the Titans was Crius, whose interest for Hesiod was as the father of Perses and grandfather of Hecate, for whom Hesiod was, according to West, an \"enthusiastic evangelist\". \n\n- Zeus (\"Ze\u00fas\", ; Modern , \"D\u00edas\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus.

His equivalent in Latin poetrythough he scarcely makes an appearance in Roman mythologywas Polus, the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve. The etymology of Coeus' name provided several scholars the theory that Coeus was also the Titan god of intellect, who represented the inquisitive mind.\n\n- In Germanic mythology, Odin (from Old Norse \u00d3\u00f0inn) is a widely revered god. In Norse mythology, from which stems most of the information about the god, Odin is associated with healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, battle, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and is the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, Odin was known in Old English as Wden, in Old Saxon as Wdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wtan, all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym wanaz.\n\n- Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\n\n- Perses ( / prsz / ; Greek :  ) was the son of the Titan siblings , Crius and Eurybia .

The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.\n\n- Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on the objects . Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms , especially resistant bacterial spores ; it is less effective than sterilization , which is an extreme physical and / or chemical process that kills all types of life . Disinfectants are different from other antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics , which destroy microorganisms within the body , and antiseptics , which destroy microorganisms on living tissue . Disinfectants are also different from biocides -- the latter are intended to destroy all forms of life , not just microorganisms . Disinfectants work by destroying the cell wall of microbes or interfering with the metabolism . Sanitizers are substances that simultaneously clean and disinfect . Disinfectants are frequently used in hospitals , dental surgeries , kitchens , and bathrooms to kill infectious organisms . Bacterial endospores are most resistant to disinfectants , but some viruses and bacteria also possess some tolerance . In wastewater treatment , a disinfection step with chlorine , ultra-violet ( UV ) radiation or ozonation can be included as tertiary treatment to remove pathogens from wastewater , for example if it is to be reused to irrigate golf courses .

Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.\nCocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.\nCocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the bloodbrain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the \"coca\" plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.\nAfter cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\"mousike\"; \"art of the Muses\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no noise, only sound.\"\n\n- The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States.

The 2016 university ratings by \"U.S. News & World Report\" rank ASU No. 1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the second year in a row.\n\n- Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.\n\n- Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.\n\n- Louis Dill Friedman (born July 7, 1941) is an American astronautics engineer and space spokesperson. He was born in New York and raised in the Bronx. Dr. Friedman was a co-founder of The Planetary Society with Carl Sagan and Bruce C.

Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.\n\n- The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.\n\n- Physics (from , from \"ph\u00fasis\" \"nature\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.\n\n- The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.\nAbout three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.\n\n- Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) is an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6\u00a0kg/23\u00a0lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named \"Sojourner\", which became the first rover to operate outside \nthe Earth-Moon system.\n\n- Arizona (O'odham: \"Al onak\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States.

Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626\u00a0km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.\n\n- A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30\u00b0 (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.\n\n- A robot is a machineespecially one programmable by a computercapable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.\n\n- The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA ) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.\n\n- Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.\n\n- Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words  \"r\", which means \"air\", and  \"nautik\" which means \"navigation\", i.e. \"navigation into the air\") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of \"aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering\" and \"the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).\" \n\n- Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace organisations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain aircraft and/or spacecraft. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications.\n\n- The Planetary Society is an American internationally active non-governmental, nonprofit foundation. It is involved in research, public outreach, and political advocacy for engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, and space exploration. It was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, and has over 40,000 members from more than one hundred countries around the world.\n\n- Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934  December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect.\n\n- In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\n\n- Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, FRAS (16 December 1917\u00a0 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.\n\n- A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \"real world\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \n\n- Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The mission is managed by the California Institute of Technology, at the JPL, in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California, for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of aerobraking, it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase. As MRO entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: \"Mars Global Surveyor\", \"Mars Express\", \"2001 Mars Odyssey\", and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (\"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\"); at the time, this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. \"Mars Global Surveyor\" and the \"Spirit\" rover have since ceased to function; the remainder remain operational as of September 2016.\n\n- A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors.

The duo's signature tune is known variously as \"The Cuckoo Song\", \"Ku-Ku\", or \"The Dance of the Cuckoos\". It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats.\n\n- The desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people  or the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem  is called public opinion. \nThe English term \"public opinion\" dates back to the seventeenth century work by John Locke, \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", which contains an early consideration of the importance of public opinion in the ordering of politics.

The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\n\n- Outwitting Dad is a 1914 American comedy film that features Oliver Hardy's first onscreen appearance.\n\n- Sailors , Beware ! is a silent comedy short film starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy prior to their official billing as the duo Laurel and Hardy .

Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.\n\n- Cama adentro is a 2004 Argentine-Spanish drama historical film written and directed by Jorge Gaggero. In Spain it is also known as Se\u00f1ora Beba. It was executive produced by Aqua Films' Ver\u00f3nica Cura. It stars Norma Aleandro, Norma Argentina and Marcos Mundstock.\n\n- In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \"kmid\u00eda\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.\n\n- A Time for Defiance (literally \"The Hour of the Brave\") is a 1998 Spanish war drama film directed by Antonio Mercero about the Spanish Civil War. Adriana Ozores won a Goya Award as Best Supporting Actress. It was also entered into the 21st Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Silver St. George.\n\n- The Official Story is a 1985 Argentine drama historical film directed by Luis Puenzo and written by Puenzo and A\u00edda Bortnik. It stars Norma Aleandro, H\u00e9ctor Alterio, Chunchuna Villafa\u00f1e and Hugo Arana. In the United Kingdom, it was released as \"The Official Version\".\n\n- Antonio Mercero (born 7 March 1936) is a Spanish director of the series Verano azul and later Farmacia de guardia. He is best known as the director of a 1972 surrealist short horror film titled \"La cabina\", that won an Emmy Award. His 1998 film \"A Time for Defiance\" was entered into the 21st Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Silver St. George. In 2010 he was awarded a Honorary Goya Award (Goya de Honor).\n\n- Norma Aleandro Robledo (born May 2, 1936) is an Argentine actress, screenwriter and theatre director. Recognised as a local film icon, Aleandro starred in the Oscar-winning 1985 film, \"The Official Story\", a role that earned her the Cannes Award for best actress. She has also performed in other successful films like \"The Truce\" (1974), \"Cousins\" (1989), \"Autumn Sun\" (1996), \"The Lighthouse\" (1998), \"Son of the Bride\" (2001) and \"Cama Adentro\" (2005).

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- A boat is a watercraft of a large range of sizes designed to float, plane, work or travel on water. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e.g., rivers and lakes) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation from a ship in an offshore environment. In naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', regardless of their size and shape. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity. \n\n- An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.\n\n- An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. \n\n- Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.\n\n- A propeller is a type of fan that transmits power by converting rotational motion into thrust. A pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blade, and a fluid (such as air or water) is accelerated behind the blade. Propeller dynamics, like those of aircraft wings, can be modelled by either or both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law. A marine propeller of this type is sometimes colloquially known as a screw propeller or screw, however there is a different class of propellers known as cycloidal propellers - they are characterized by the higher propulsive efficiency averaging 0.72 compared to the screw propellers average of 0.6 and the ability to throw thrust in any direction at any time. Their disadvantages are higher mechanical complexity and higher cost.\n\n- A steamboat is a boat that is propelled primarily by steam power, typically driving propellers or paddlewheels. Steamboats sometimes use the prefix designation SS, S.S. or S/S (for 'Screw Steamer') or PS (for 'Paddle Steamer'), however these designations are most often used for Steamships.\n\n- The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War\u00a0II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War\u00a0II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.\n\n- The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.\n\n- A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \"in mothballs\" or \"mothballed\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \"ghost fleet\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \"laid up in ordinary\".\n\n- A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is an ocean faring seaworthy vessel that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically drive (turn) propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s; however, there were exceptions that came before. Steamships usually use the prefix designations of \"PS\" for \"paddle steamer\" or \"SS\" for \"screw steamer\" (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, \"SS\" is assumed by many to stand for \"steam ship\". Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as \"MV\" for \"motor vessel\", so it is not correct to use \"SS\" for most modern vessels.\n\n- The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .\n\n- The third USS Vixen was a steamboat in the United States Navy during the Mexican - American War .\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'uss vixen '.\n\nChoices:\n- air force\n - airbase\n - aircraft\n - armed forces\n - army\n - boat\n - body of water\n - cabinet\n - capital\n - class\n - coast guard\n - code\n - collection\n - combat\n - combustion\n - corps\n - cost\n - council\n - deck\n - definition\n - designation\n - direction\n - environment\n - fighter\n - fleet\n - fluid\n - history\n - identity\n - machine\n - military\n - motion\n - naval warfare\n - navy\n - operation\n - paddle\n - principal\n - range\n - result\n - sea\n - security\n - service\n - seven\n - ship\n - size\n - steamboat\n - steamship\n - ten\n - three\n - time\n - tradition\n - two\n - war\n - warship\n", "completion": "steamship<|endoftext|>"}

Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells (coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint (a type of chert unique to chalk) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).\n\n- M\u00f8n is an island in south-eastern Denmark.

More broadly, \"the sea\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \"Challenger\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \"seas\".\n\n- The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea.

It is the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland's principal seaport and is also the centre of the country's fourth-largest metropolitan area.\n\n- Longitude (or , Australian and British also ), is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees and denoted by the Greek letter lambda (). Meridians (lines running from the North Pole to the South Pole) connect points with the same longitude. By convention, one of these, the Prime Meridian, which passes through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England, was allocated the position of zero degrees longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west from the Prime Meridian, ranging from 0\u00b0 at the Prime Meridian to +180\u00b0 eastward and 180\u00b0 westward. Specifically, it is the angle between a plane containing the Prime Meridian and a plane containing the North Pole, South Pole and the location in question. (This forms a right-handed coordinate system with the axis (right hand thumb) pointing from the Earth's center toward the North Pole and the axis (right hand index finger) extending from Earth's center through the equator at the Prime Meridian.)\n\n- Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.\n\n- The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea.

The interior is of particular historical interest , in view of the many frescos dating back to the 13th and 16th centuries and Fanefjord Church is considered the most famous attraction on M\u00f8n .\n\n- The Great Belt,, is a strait between the major islands of Zealand (\"Sj\u00e6lland\") and Funen (\"Fyn\") in Denmark. It is one of the three Danish Straits.\n\n- \u00d8resund or \u00d6resund is a strait which forms the DanishSwedish border,\nseparating Sj\u00e6lland (Denmark) from Sk\u00e5ne (Sweden). \nThe strait has a length of and the width varies from to . It is wide at its narrowest point between Helsing\u00f8r in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden. \n\n- The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \"Old World\" from the \"New World\".\n\n- The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain. It includes the Gulf of Bothnia, the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, and the Bay of Gdask. The sea stretches from 53\u00b0N to 66\u00b0N latitude and from 10\u00b0E to 30\u00b0E longitude. A mediterranean sea of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the Danish islands into the Kattegat by way of the straits of \u00d8resund, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt.\n\n- In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the Equator to 90\u00b0 (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth.\nApproximations employed.\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \"actual\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.\n\n- Langeb\u00e6k is a town with a population of 242 (1 January 2015) and a former municipality (Danish, \"kommune\") in Region Sj\u00e6lland on the southeastern tip of the island of Zealand (\"Sj\u00e6lland\") in south Denmark.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\"mousike\"; \"art of the Muses\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no noise, only sound.\"\n\n- Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located east of Seattle, within the Seattle metropolitan area.

The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.\n\n- Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \"Tanakh\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).\n\n- The Secret Magdalene , American Ki Longfellow 's third book , was published in 2005 .

It is told entirely in the first - person voice of Mariamne . A hardback edition was published by Random House in 2006 , followed by a trade paperback edition published by Three Rivers Press , a Random House imprint , in December 2007 . It has been translated into several languages , including Spanish , Czech , Chinese , French and Icelandic . It is a tale of Mariamne 's quest to understand the gnosis she experienced as a child . Longfellow said she based the book on her studies of translations of historic Jewish and Arabic texts , as well as on modern Biblical scholarship . A selected bibliography is included .\n\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \"literatura\"/\"litteratura\" (derived itself from \"littera\": \"letter\" or \"handwriting\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\n\n- The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God.

He is a descendant of Western Australian Noongar people .\n\n- The Noongar (alternatively spelt Nyungar, Nyoongar, Nyoongah, Nyungah, or Noonga) are an Indigenous Australian people who live in the south-west corner of Western Australia, from Geraldton on the west coast to Esperance on the south coast. Traditionally, they inhabit the region from Jurien Bay to the southern coast of Western Australia, and east to what is now Ravensthorpe and Southern Cross, south west of the circumcision line separating those Aboriginal groups of central Australia that practised male circumcision upon initiation from those who did not. Noongar country, according to Norman Tindale, was occupied by 14 different groups: and . The Noongar traditionally spoke dialects of the Noongar language, a member of the large Pama-Nyungan language family, but generally today speak Australian Aboriginal English (a dialect of the English language) combined with Noongar words and grammar. Although Noongar today still recognise the existence of these groups, most Noongar today trace their ancestry to more than one of these groups.\n\n- Male circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, the circumcision device (if used) is placed, and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is occasionally used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option, and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious and cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for a condition or for preventative reasons. Medically, it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.\nThe positions of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective circumcision of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision for all males (aside from the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) for areas with high rates of HIV), or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons, and for that reason the procedure is controversial.\nEvidence supports that male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV, such as Sub Saharan Africa. Evidence for a health benefit against HIV for men who have sex with men is less clear....\n\n- Australian Aboriginal English (AAE) refers to a dialect of Australian English used by a large section of the Indigenous Australian population. It is made up of a number of varieties which developed differently in different parts of Australia. These varieties are generally said to fit along a continuum ranging from light forms, close to Standard Australian English, to heavy forms, closer to Kriol. There are generally distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. AAE is not to be confused with Kriol, which is a separate language from English spoken by over 30,001 people in Australia. Speakers have been noted to tend to change between different forms of AAE depending on who they are speaking to, e.g. striving to speak more like Australian English when speaking to a non-Indigenous English speaking person.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'languages spoken or written' with the subject 'kim scott'.\n\nChoices:\n- australian english\n - coptic\n - english\n - latin\n", "completion": "australian english<|endoftext|>"}

'concerning law') means 'a state of affairs that is in accordance with law', i.e. that is officially designated. In contrast, \"de facto\" (lit. 'concerning fact'), means 'a state of affairs that is true in fact, but that is not officially designated'. In law, and in government, the terms \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" are used instead of 'in law' and 'in practice', respectively. In a legal context, \"de jure\" (laws) are contrasted to \"de facto\" practices, where, for example, the people obey a contract as though there were a law enforcing it, yet there is no such law. A process known as 'desuetude' may allow \"de facto\" practices to replace \"de jure\" laws that have fallen out of favour locally.\n\n- De facto is a Latin expression that means \"in fact, in reality, in actual existence, force, or possession, as a matter of fact\" (literally \"of fact\"). In law, it often means \"in practice but not necessarily ordained by law\" or \"in practice or actuality, but not officially designated or established\". It is commonly used in contrast to \"\" (which means \"according to law\"; literally \"from law\"), when referring to matters of law, governance, or technique (such as standards) that are found in the common experience as created or developed without or contrary to a regulation. When discussing a legal situation, \"de jure\" designates what the law says, while \"de facto\" designates what happens in practice.\n\n- Hispaniola (Spanish: \"La Espa\u00f1ola\"; Latin: \"Hispaniola\"; Ta\u00edno: \"Haiti\") is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the tenth most populous island in the world.\n\n- In English law, a fee simple or fee simple absolute is an estate in land, a form of freehold ownership. It is a way that real estate may be owned in common law countries, and is the highest possible ownership interest that can be held in real property. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. The rights of the fee simple owner are limited by government powers of taxation, compulsory purchase, police power, and escheat, and it could also be limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land to be used as a public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a fee simple conditional.\n\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \"continent\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\n\n- A peasant is a member of a traditional class of farmers, either laborers or owners of small farms, especially in the Middle Ages under feudalism, or more generally, in any pre-industrial society. In Europe, peasants were divided into three classes according to their personal status: slave, serf, and free tenant. Peasants either hold title to land in fee simple, or hold land by any of several forms of land tenure, among them socage, quit-rent, leasehold, and copyhold.\n\n- The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.\n\n- Creolization is the process in which Creole cultures emerge in the New World. As a result of colonization there was a mixture among people of indigenous, African, and European descent, which came to be understood as Creolization. Creolization is traditionally used to refer to the Caribbean; although not exclusive to the Caribbean it can be further extended to represent other diasporas. The mixing of people brought a cultural mixing which ultimately led to the formation of new identities. It is important to emphasize that creolization also is the mixing of the \"old\" and \"traditional\" with the \"new\" and \"modern\". Furthermore, creolization occurs when participants actively select cultural elements that may become part of or inherited culture. Robin Cohen states that creolization is a condition in which \"the formation of new identities and inherited culture evolve to become different from those they possessed in the original cultures,\" and then creatively merge these to create new varieties that supersede the prior forms.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'languages spoken or written' with the subject 'sidney mintz'.\n\nChoices:\n- english\n - latin\n - nahuatl\n - romance languages\n - spanish\n - turkish\n", "completion": "english<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet.\n\n- Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is called not by its own name but rather by a metonym, the name of something associated in meaning with that thing or concept. The words \"metonymy\" and \"metonym\" come from the , , \"a change of name\", from , , \"after, beyond\" and , , a suffix used to name figures of speech, from , or , , \"name\".\n\n- Pars pro toto , Latin for `` a part ( taken ) for the whole '' , is a figure of speech where the name of a portion of an object , place , or concept represents its entirety . It is distinct from a merism , which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts ; metonymy , where an object , place , or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object , place , or concept ; or synecdoche , which can refer both to this and its inverse of the whole representing a part . In the context of language , pars pro toto means that something is named after a part of it , or after a limited characteristic , in itself not necessarily representative for the whole . For example , `` glasses '' is a pars pro toto name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass . Pars pro toto is a common device in iconography , where a particular icon can stand for a complete set of characteristics . James George Frazer used `` pars pro toto '' to explain his concept of contagious magic . Examples of common pars pro toto usage in political geography include `` Russia '' or `` Russians '' , for the entire former Russian Empire or former Soviet Union or its people , Taiwan or Taipei ( `` Chinese Taipei '' ) for Republic of China , Holland for the Netherlands , and , particularly in languages other than English , using the translation of `` England '' in that language for `` United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' . Among English - speakers `` Great Britain '' is a common pars pro toto shorthand for the entire United Kingdom . Switzerland 's name ( in German Schweiz ) comes from its central Canton of Schwyz . The inverse of a pars pro toto is a totum pro parte , in which the whole is used to describe a part , such as widespread use of `` America '' ( which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically , with alliteration , alongside Asia , Africa , `` Europa , '' and ultimately Arctica , Antarctica and Australia ) in place of `` United States of America...\n\n- The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \"Ethnologue\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family.\n\n- In law, a merism is a figure of speech by which a single thing is referred to by a conventional phrase that enumerates several of its parts, \"or\" which lists several synonyms for the same thing.\n\n- A synecdoche (; from Greek , \"synekdoche\", . \"simultaneous understanding\") is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa. A synecdoche is a class of metonymy, often by means of either mentioning a part for the whole or conversely the whole for one of its parts. Examples from common English expressions include \"bread and butter\" (for \"livelihood\"), \"suits\" (for \"businesspeople\"), and \"boots\" (for \"soldiers\") (Pars pro toto), or conversely \"America\" (for \"the United States of America\") (Totum pro parte). \n\n- Totum pro parte is Latin for \"the whole for a part\"; it refers to a kind of synecdoche. The plural is tota pro partibus, \"wholes for parts\". When used in a context of language it means that something is named after something of which it is only a part (or only a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole). A \"pars pro toto\" (in which a part is used to describe the whole) is the opposite of a \"totum pro parte\".\n\n- A classical language is a language with a literature that is \"classical\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, \"it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.\"\n\n- Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.\n\n- The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.\n\n- In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\"), or several (\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\").\nA complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\"), or more than one root in a compound (\"black-board, rat-race\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\"a red rock\"), clauses (\"I threw a rock\"), and sentences (\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\").\n\n- A figure of speech or rhetorical figure is figurative language in the form of a single word or phrase. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words. Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as any figure of speech introduces an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.\n\n- Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'pars pro toto'.\n\nChoices:\n- alphabet\n - behavior\n - bengali\n - branch\n - butter\n - century\n - change\n - collective\n - complex\n - concept\n - emphasis\n - family\n - figure of speech\n - language\n - language family\n - law\n - legislature\n - limited\n - may\n - metonymy\n - name\n - part\n - phrase\n - population\n - process\n - race\n - rat\n - representative\n - running\n - science\n - script\n - single\n - speech\n - state\n - suffix\n - system\n - term\n - tradition\n - understanding\n - vice\n - word\n - writing\n", "completion": "phrase<|endoftext|>"}

Scarba and Kerrera which lie nearby, are not usually included.\n\n- The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \"Innse Gall\"; Old Norse: \"Su\u00f0reyjar\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.\n\n- Scarba is a small island, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, just north of the much larger island of Jura. The island was owned by Richard Hill, 7th Baron Sandys and has not been permanently inhabited since the 1960s. It is now covered in heather and used for grazing animals.

Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).\n\n- A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.\n\n- The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.\n\n- An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.\n\n- The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \"Airish Sea\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man.

Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.\n\n- Bolzano (or ; German: \"Bozen\", ; Ladin: \"Balsan\" or \"Bulsan\") is the capital city of the province of South Tyrol in northern Italy.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively.\n\n- The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \"Swallow\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow.\n\n- In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.\n\n- Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \"Pinax theatri botanici\" (English, \"Illustrated exposition of plants\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.\n\n- Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.\n\n- A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \"oscen\", \"a songbird\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song.\n\n- Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.\n\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \"mamma\" \"breast\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \"Haldanodon.\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\n\n- Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. \n\n- Feathers are epidermal growths that form the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates, and indeed a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups.\n\n- A genus (\u00a0genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.\n\n- Cowbirds are birds belonging to the genus Molothrus in the family Icteridae. They are brood parasitic New World birds which are unrelated to the Old World cuckoos, one of which, the common cuckoo, is the most famous brood parasitic bird.\n\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\n\n- Brood parasites are organisms that rely on others to raise their young. The strategy appears among birds, insects and some fish. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own.\n\n- Plumage (\"feather\") refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes. Within species there can be different colour morphs.\n\n- In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.\n\n- The barn swallow (\"Hirundo rustica\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \"swallow\" rather than a \"martin\".\n\n- Shrikes are carnivorous passerine birds of the family Laniidae. The family is composed of thirty-one species in four genera. They are fairly closely related to the bush-shrike family Malaconotidae.\n\n- The cuckoo-finch (\"Anomalospiza imberbis\"), also known as the parasitic weaver or cuckoo weaver, is a small passerine bird now placed in the family Viduidae with the indigobirds and whydahs. It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds.\n\n- A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).\nThe passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.\n\n- The saw - wings , Psalidoprocne , is a small genus of passerine birds in the swallow family . The common name of this group is derived from the rough outer edge of the outer primary feather on the wing , which is rough due to recurved barbs . The function of this is unknown . The birds are 11 -- 17 cm long and black or black - and - white in colour . The genus has an African distribution and all species can be found foraging over forest and woodland .\n\n- Rodents (from Latin \"rodere\", \"to gnaw\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.\n\n- Passer is a genus of sparrows, also known as the true sparrows. The genus includes the house sparrow and the Eurasian tree sparrow, some of the most common birds in the world. They are small birds with thick bills for eating seeds, and are mostly coloured grey or brown. Native to the Old World, some species have been introduced throughout the world.\n\n- The order Squamata, or the scaled reptiles, are the largest recent order of reptiles, comprising all lizards and snakes. With over 10,000 species, it is also the second-largest order of extant vertebrates, after the perciform fish, and roughly equal in number to the Saurischia (one of the 2 major groups of dinosaurs). Members of the order are distinguished by their skins, which bear horny scales or shields. They also possess movable quadrate bones, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the neurocranium. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. They are the most variably sized order of reptiles, ranging from the dwarf gecko (\"Sphaerodactylus ariasae\") to the green anaconda (\"Eunectes murinus\") and the now-extinct mosasaurs, which reached lengths of .\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'saw-wing'.\n\nChoices:\n- amniota\n - animal\n - anomalospiza\n - bear\n - bird\n - chordata\n - cuculidae\n - eunectes\n - helix\n - hirundinidae\n - hirundo\n - homo\n - human\n - icteridae\n - insects\n - mammal\n - ostrich\n - passer\n - rodentia\n - sauropsida\n - shrike\n - sparrow\n - sphaerodactylus\n - squamata\n - theria\n - vertebrata\n", "completion": "hirundinidae<|endoftext|>"}

Administratively, it is one of China's four direct-controlled municipalities (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and the only such municipality in inland China.\n\n- Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub.\n\n- The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors.\n\n- Wang Mang (c. 45  6 October 23\u00a0AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \"renewed\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.\n\n- Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province.\n\n- Bao Xin ( 152 -- 192 ) was a military general who lived during the late Han Dynasty of China . Initially , he participated in the imperial campaign against the Yellow Turbans along with other regional warlords . After the rise of Dong Zhuo , who usurped the power of the Imperial Court , Bao joined the campaign against Dong Zhuo . During a battle at Sishui Pass , he disobeyed orders from the alliance 's leader Yuan Shao and instructed his younger brother , Bao Zhong , to engage the enemy commander Hua Xiong , with around 5,000 armored cavalry . However , the raid failed and Bao Zhong was slain . Later he served under Xiahou Dun , one of Cao Cao 's highest - ranked generals . He was killed in 192 in an assault against one of the Yellow Turban rebels ' strongholds in Shouzhang ( southwest of present - day Dongping County ) .\n\n- The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.\n\n- The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \"Three Kingdoms\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \"Three Kingdoms\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.\n\n- The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.\n\n- Dong Zhuo (died 22 May 192), courtesy name Zhongying, was a politician and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He seized control of the capital Luoyang in 189 when it was in a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling and a clash between the eunuch faction and some court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Emperor Shao and instated Emperor Xian.\n\n- Combat arms (or fighting arms in non-American parlance) is a collective name in a system of administrative military reference to those troops within national armed forces which participate in direct tactical ground combat. In general they include units that carry or employ a weapon system such as infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. The use of multiple combat arms in mutually supporting ways is known as combined arms.\n\n- Yuan Shao (died 28 June 202), courtesy name Benchu, was a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He occupied the northern territories of China during the civil war that occurred towards the end of the Han Dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era. He was also an elder half-brother of Yuan Shu, a warlord who controlled the Huai River region, though the two were not on good terms with each other.\n\n- H.O.R.S.E. is a form of poker commonly played at the high-stakes tables of casinos. It consists of rounds of play cycling among:\n\n- Hua Xiong (died 191) was a military general under the warlord Dong Zhuo during the late Eastern Han Dynasty of China. In 190, various warlords from around the country formed a coalition against Dong Zhuo, who was holding Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial court. In one of the battles against the coalition, Hua Xiong, holding the rank of Chief Controller (), was executed after his force was defeated by Sun Jian at Yangren ().\n\n- Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC  June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202  195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class.\n\n- A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.\n\n- Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\n- The end of the Han dynasty refers to the period of Chinese history from 189 to 220 AD, which roughly coincides with the tumultuous reign of the Han dynasty's last ruler, Emperor Xian. During this period, the country was thrown into turmoil by the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184-205). Meanwhile, the Han Empire's institutions were destroyed by the warlord Dong Zhuo, and fractured into regional regimes ruled by various warlords, some of whom were nobles and officials of the Han imperial court. Eventually, one of those warlords, Cao Cao, was able to gradually reunify the empire, ostensibly under Emperor Xian's rule, but the empire was actually controlled by Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao's efforts to completely reunite the Han empire were rebuffed at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 / 209, when his armies were defeated by the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao's son and heir, Cao Pi, pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour. Cao Pi became the emperor of a new state, Cao Wei. A year later, in response to Cao Pi's usurpation of the Han throne, Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han; and in 229, Sun Quan followed suit, declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu. The period from Emperor Xian's abdication in 220 to the partial reunification of China under the Jin dynasty in 265 was known as the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.\n\n- Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry.\n\n- A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer.\n\n- Sun Jian (155191), courtesy name Wentai, was a military general and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He allied himself with Yuan Shu in 190 when warlords from eastern China formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who held the puppet Emperor Xian in his power. Although he controlled neither many troops nor much land, Sun Jian's personal bravery and resourcefulness were feared by Dong Zhuo, who placed him among Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao as the most influential men at that time. After the coalition disbanded in the next year, China fell into massive civil war. In 191, Sun Jian was killed in battle during an offensive campaign against Liu Biao.\n\n- East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe.\n\n- The Huai River, formerly romanized as the Hwai, is a major river in China. It is located about midway between the Yellow River and Yangtze, the two largest rivers in China, and like them runs from west to east. Historically draining directly into the Yellow Sea, floods have changed the course of the river such that it is now a major tributary of the Yangtze. The Huai is notoriously vulnerable to flooding.\n\n- The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\".\nIt was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220\u00a0AD).\n\n- A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.\n\n- A warrior is a person specializing in combat or warfare, especially within the context of a tribal or clan-based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior class or caste.\n\n- Mounted infantry were infantry who rode horses instead of marching, but, as infantry does in general, fought on foot (in the modern era with muskets or rifles, but before that with swords, spears, bows, or crossbows). In contrast, cavalry fought on horseback. The original dragoons were essentially mounted infantry. According to the 1911 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"Mounted rifles are half cavalry, mounted infantry merely specially mobile infantry.\" Today, with motor vehicles having replaced horses for military transport, the motorized infantry are in some respects successors to mounted infantry.\n\n- He Jin (died 22 September 189), courtesy name Suigao, was the elder half-brother of Empress He, consort to Emperor Ling of the late Eastern Han Dynasty in China. He shared power with his sister as regents in 189, following the death of Emperor Ling. In the ensuing struggle with the influential eunuch faction for power, He Jin was assassinated. His death allowed Dong Zhuo to seize military control over the capital Luoyang and take control of the imperial court. The subsequent breakdown of central command brought forth the beginning of massive civil wars which led to the formation of the era known as the Three Kingdoms.\n\n- Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south.\nTaiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.\n\n- The Campaign against Dong Zhuo was a punitive expedition initiated by a coalition of regional officials and warlords against the warlord Dong Zhuo in 190 in the late Eastern Han dynasty. The members of the coalition claimed that Dong had the intention of usurping the throne by holding Emperor Xian hostage and by establishing a strong influence in the imperial court. They justified their campaign as to remove Dong from power. The campaign led to the evacuation of the capital Luoyang and the shifting of the imperial court to Chang'an. It was a prelude to the end of the Han dynasty and, subsequently, the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n- Jurisdiction (from the Latin \"ius, \" meaning \"law\" and \"\" meaning \"to speak\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law.\n\n- Cavalry (from French \"cavalerie\", cf. \"cheval\" 'horse') or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman, horseman, dragoon or trooper. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military forces that used other animals, such as camels, mules or elephants. Infantry who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as dragoons, a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.\n\n- China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381\u00a0billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.\n\n- The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army. \n\n- A punitive expedition is a military journey undertaken to punish a state or any group of persons outside the borders of the punishing state. It is usually undertaken in response to perceived disobedient or morally wrong behavior, either as revenge or to apply strong diplomatic pressure without a formal declaration of war. More commonly in the 19th century, punitive expeditions were used as pretexts to colonial adventures that resulted in annexations, regime changes or changes in policies of the affected state to favour one or more colonial powers.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'bao xin'.\n\nChoices:\n- army\n - confucian scholar\n - construction\n - dragoon\n - emperor\n - eunuch\n - founder\n - general\n - justice\n - king\n - leader\n - major\n - member\n - military\n - officer\n - official\n - politician\n - r\n - ruler\n - script\n - social reformer\n - soldier\n - sovereign\n - taiwan\n - warrior\n", "completion": "officer<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \"continent\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\n\n- Canterbury (, or ) is a historic English cathedral city and UNESCO World Heritage Site, which lies at the heart of the City of Canterbury, a local government district of Kent, England. It lies on the River Stour.\n\n- Augustine of Canterbury (first third of the 6th century\u00a0 probably 26 May 604) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597. He is considered the \"Apostle to the English\" and a founder of the English Church.\n\n- Mother church (Lat. \"Mater Ecclesiae\") is a term, especially in Catholicism, depicting the Christian Church as a mother in its functions of nourishing and protecting the believer. It may also refer to the mother church of a diocese i.e. Cathedral or a metropolitan church. The term has specific meanings within different Christian denominations.\n\n- The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century.\n\n- The Anglican Communion is an international association of autonomous churches consisting of the Church of England and national and regional Anglican churches (\"provinces\") in full communion with it. Full participation in the sacramental life of each church is available to all communicant Anglicans.\n\n- The Gregorian mission or Augustinian mission was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to convert Britain's Anglo-Saxons. Headed by Augustine of Canterbury, by the death of the last missionary in 635 the mission had established Christianity in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and Frankish missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the Hiberno-Scottish missions to Continental Europe.\n\n- The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \"\" meaning \"administration\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.\n\n- Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury and the most senior bishop in the Church of England. Welby was the vicar of Southam, Warwickshire, and most recently was the Bishop of Durham, serving for just over a year. As Archbishop of Canterbury he is the Primate of All England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion.\n\n- The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across all of Europe during this period. Many factors contributed to the process: the decline of feudalism and the rise of nationalism, the rise of the common law, the invention of the printing press and increased circulation of the Bible, and the transmission of new knowledge and ideas among scholars, the upper and middle classes and readers in general. However, the various phases of the English Reformation, which also covered Wales and Ireland, were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion gradually accommodated itself.\n\n- A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \"Christian\" derives from the Koine Greek word \"Christ\u00f3s\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \"mashiach\".\n\n- The Province of Canterbury, or less formally the Southern Province, is one of two ecclesiastical provinces which constitute the Church of England. The other is the Province of York (which consists of 12 dioceses). It consists of 30 dioceses, covering roughly two-thirds of England, parts of Wales, and the Channel Islands, with the remainder comprising continental Europe (under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe).\n\n- The Province of York is one of two ecclesiastical provinces making up the Church of England and consists of 12 dioceses which cover the northern third of England and the Isle of Man. York was elevated to an archbishopric in \u00a0735: Ecgbert was the first archbishop. At one time the Archbishops of York also claimed metropolitan authority over Scotland but these claims were never realised and ceased when the Archdiocese of St Andrews was established.\n\n- England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.\n\n- An ecclesiastical province is a general term for large jurisdiction of Christian religious government including Western Christianity and Eastern Christianity. In the Greco-Roman world, \"ecclesia\" (Greek , \"ekklsi\" (Latin ecclesia) meaning \"congregation, church\") was used to refer to a lawful assembly, or a called legislative body. As early as Pythagoras, the word took on the additional meaning of a community with shared beliefs. This is the meaning taken in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Septuagint), and later adopted by the Christian community to refer to the assembly of believers.\n\n- The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \"Apostle to the English\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams.\n\n- A national church is a Christian church associated with a specific ethnic group or nation state. The idea was notably discussed during the 19th century, during the emergence of modern nationalism.\n\n- London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \"Londinium\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.\n\n- The Bishop of Portsmouth is the Ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Portsmouth in the Province of Canterbury . The diocese covers south - east Hampshire and the Isle of Wight and has its see in the City of Portsmouth , where the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Thomas of Canterbury which was elevated to cathedral status in 1927 . The office of bishop was created in 1927 when the new diocese was formed from part of the Diocese of Winchester . The current bishop is the Right Reverend Christopher Foster , the 9th Bishop of Portsmouth , who signs + Christopher Portsmouth . Previously Suffragan Bishop of Hertford , his nomination as Bishop of Portsmouth was announced by Downing Street on 9 February 2010 . He was installed and enthroned in a service at Portsmouth Cathedral on 18 September 2010 .

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee.\n\n- The uterus (from Latin \"uterus\", plural \"uteri\") or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of humans and most other mammals. In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation. In the embryo the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus. The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus.\n\n- Anatomically, a nose is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants. On most other mammals, it is located on the upper tip of the snout.\n\n- Altricial, meaning \"requiring nourishment\", refers to a pattern of growth and development in organisms which are incapable of moving around on their own soon after hatching or being born. The word is derived from the Latin root \"alere\" meaning \"to nurse, to rear, or to nourish\" and refers to the need for young to be fed and taken care of for a long duration. Species whose young are immediately or quickly mobile are known as precocial.\n\n- Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \"mamma\" \"breast\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \"Haldanodon.\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.\n\n- An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial.\n\n- The rib cage is an arrangement of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs. In humans, the rib cage, also known as the thoracic cage, is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), forming a core portion of the human skeleton. A typical human rib cage consists of 24 ribs, the sternum (with xiphoid process), costal cartilages, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae. Together with the skin and associated fascia and muscles, the rib cage makes up the thoracic wall and provides attachments for the muscles of the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and back.\n\n- Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis.\n\n- The skeleton (from Greek , \"skelet\u00f3s\" \"dried up\") is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism. There are several different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body, the hydroskeleton, and the cytoskeleton.\n\n- A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.\n\n- Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. \n\n- A joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones in the body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) in order to protect the brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.\n\n- Birth, also known as parturition, is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's pouch.\n\n- Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside female viviparous animals. It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time (multiple gestations).\n\n- Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic tissue, rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is stiffer and less flexible than muscle.\n\n- A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).\n\n- White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.\n\n- A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebrate skeleton. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple functions. \n\n- The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \"ear\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.\n\n- Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka.\n\n- Atelosteogenesis , type II is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development . It is extremely rare , and infants with the disorder are usually stillborn ; however , those who survive birth die soon after from respiratory failure .\n\n- In biology, the term precocial refers to species in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching. The opposite developmental strategy is called \"altricial\" where the young are born or hatched helpless. Extremely precocial species may be called \"superprecocial\". These three categories form a continuum, without distinct gaps between them. Precocial species are normally nidifugous, meaning that they leave the nest shortly after birth or hatching.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'atelosteogenesis'.\n\nChoices:\n- 12\n - amino acid\n - articulation\n - bearing\n - biology\n - bone\n - brain\n - cage\n - cause\n - chemical\n - class\n - collective\n - column\n - complex\n - composition\n - contract\n - disease\n - extinct\n - fish\n - food\n - force\n - head\n - hearing\n - hormone\n - human\n - humans\n - infectious\n - infectious disease\n - joint\n - key\n - ligament\n - member\n - mineral\n - moment\n - motion\n - muscle\n - offspring\n - order\n - organ\n - part\n - pattern\n - process\n - protein\n - rib\n - sex\n - side\n - single\n - skeleton\n - skull\n - species\n - stable\n - store\n - structure\n - surface\n - system\n - three\n - time\n - tissue\n - variety\n - wall\n - word\n", "completion": "disease<|endoftext|>"}

The practice of such argumentation is called \"polemics\". A person who often writes polemics, or who speaks polemically, is called a \"polemicist\". The word is derived , .\n\n- Linda Hutcheon, FRS, O.C. (born August 24, 1947) is a Canadian academic working in the fields of literary theory and criticism, opera, and Canadian studies. She is University Professor in the Department of English and of the Centre for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto, where she has taught since 1988. In 2000 she was elected the 117th President of the Modern Language Association, the third Canadian to hold this position, and the first Canadian woman. She is particularly known for her influential theories of postmodernism.\n\n- Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \"literatura\"/\"litteratura\" (derived itself from \"littera\": \"letter\" or \"handwriting\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\n\n- Gooflumps is the name given to a two - part parody series written in 1995 by Tom Hughes under the pseudonym of R. U. Slime .\n\n- Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.\n\n- Imitation (from Latin \"imitatio\", \"a copying, imitation\") is an advanced behavior whereby an individual observes and replicates another's behavior. Imitation is also a form of social learning that leads to the \"development of traditions, and ultimately our culture. It allows for the transfer of information (behaviours, customs, etc.) between individuals and down generations without the need for genetic inheritance.\" The word \"imitation\" can be applied in many contexts, ranging from animal training to international politics. The term generally refers to conscious behavior; subconscious imitation is termed mirroring.\n\n- A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.\n\n- A parody (also called a spoof, send-up, take-off, or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original workits subject, author, style, or some other targetby means of satiric or ironic imitation. As the literary theorist Linda Hutcheon puts it, \"parody  is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\" Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as \"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice.\"\nParody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music (although \"parody\" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), animation, gaming, and film.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'genre' with the subject 'gooflumps'.\n\nChoices:\n- animation\n - art\n - book\n - computer animation\n - criticism\n - culture\n - genre\n - information\n - literature\n - music\n - novel\n - opera\n - optical illusion\n - parody\n - poetry\n - polemic\n - rhetoric\n - traditional animation\n", "completion": "novel<|endoftext|>"}

Numbering over 100, they are located between the mouths of the Santee and St. Johns Rivers along the coast of the US states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n\n- A marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species. Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as swamps, which are dominated by trees, and mires, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic peat.\n\n- An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.\n\n- Amelia Island, in Nassau County, Florida, is the southernmost of the Sea Islands, a chain of barrier islands stretching along the east coast of the United States from South Carolina to Florida.

As of the 2010 census, the population was 73,314. The county seat and largest incorporated city is Fernandina Beach.\n\n- A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \"the sea\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \"Challenger\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \"seas\".\n\n- Salinity is the saltiness or dissolved salt content of a body of water (see also soil salinity).\nSalinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry\nof natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water.\n\n- Barrier islands are coastal landforms and a type of dune system that are exceptionally flat or lumpy areas of sand that form by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coast. They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish. A barrier chain may extend uninterrupted for over a hundred kilometers, excepting the tidal inlets that separate the islands, the longest and widest being Padre Island of Texas. The length and width of barriers and overall morphology of barrier coasts are related to parameters including tidal range, wave energy, sediment supply, sea-level trends, and basement controls.\n\n- Fort Clinch is a 19th-century masonry coastal fortification, built as part of the Third System of seacoast defense conceived by the United States. It is located on a peninsula near the northernmost point of Amelia Island in Nassau County, Florida. The fort lies to the northeast of Fernandina Beach at the entrance to the Cumberland Sound (Florida), in the northeast part of the state. Today it is included within the boundaries of Fort Clinch State Park.\n\n- Florida (Spanish for \"land of flowers\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.\n\n- An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus \"Gossypium\" in the family of \"Malvaceae\". The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds.\n\n- A loom is a device used to weave cloth and tapestry. The basic purpose of any loom is to hold the warp threads under tension to facilitate the interweaving of the weft threads. The precise shape of the loom and its mechanics may vary, but the basic function is the same.\n\n- Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile or fabric.\n\n- A braid (also referred to as a plait) is a complex structure or pattern formed by interlacing three or more strands of flexible material such as textile yarns, wire, or hair. Compared with the process of weaving, which usually involves two separate, perpendicular groups of strands (warp and weft), a braid is usually long and narrow, with each component strand functionally equivalent in zigzagging forward through the overlapping mass of the others. The most common braid is a flat, solid, three-stranded structure. More complex braids can be constructed from an arbitrary number of strands to create a wider range of structures.\nBraids have been made for thousands of years in many different cultures, and for a variety of uses. Traditionally, the materials used in braids have depended on the indigenous plants and animals available in the local area.\n\n- Community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting. Community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest. They broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local, specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or mass-media broadcasters.\nCommunity radio stations are operated, owned, and influenced by the communities they serve. They are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals, groups, and communities to tell their own stories, to share experiences and, in a media-rich world, to become creators and contributors of media.\n\n- A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting.\n\n- Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, and ropemaking. Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing. Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for hand or machine embroidery.\n\n- WEFT Champaign 90.1FM is a listener-supported community radio station in Champaign, Illinois, founded in 1981 and owned by Prairie Air, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation. WEFT typically broadcasts 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. It has a wide range of programming, including music from a range of genres, local and nationally produced public affairs programming, live music, spoken word, and more.

Felt can be made of natural fibers such as wool, or from synthetic fibers such as petroleum-based acrylic or acrylonitrile or wood pulp-based rayon. Blended fibers are also common. \n\n- Crochet is a process of creating fabric by interlocking loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials using a crochet hook. The name is derived from the French term \"crochet\", meaning \"small hook.\" These are made of materials such as metal, wood, or plastic and are manufactured commercially and produced in artisan workshops. The salient difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before proceeding with the next one, while knitting keeps a large number of stitches open at a time. (Variant forms such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.)\n\n- Tapestry is a form of textile art, traditionally woven on a vertical loom. Tapestry is weft-faced weaving, in which all the warp threads are hidden in the completed work, unlike cloth weaving where both the warp and the weft threads may be visible. In tapestry weaving, weft yarns are typically discontinuous; the artisan interlaces each coloured weft back and forth in its own small pattern area. It is a plain weft-faced weave having weft threads of different colours worked over portions of the warp to form the design.\n\n- Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. (\"Weft\" or \"woof\" is an old English word meaning \"that which is woven\".) The method in which these threads are inter woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.\nCloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back-strap, or other techniques without looms.\n\n- Champaign is a city in Champaign County, Illinois, United States. The city is south of Chicago, west of Indianapolis, Indiana, and northeast of St. Louis, Missouri. The United States Census Bureau estimates the city was home to 84,513 people as of July 1, 2014. Champaign is the tenth-most populous city in Illinois, and the state's fourth-most populous city outside of the Chicago metropolitan area.\n\n- Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.\n\n- Tablet Weaving (often card weaving in the United States) is a weaving technique where \"tablets\" or \"cards\" are used to create the shed through which the weft is passed. As the materials and tools are relatively cheap and easy to obtain, tablet weaving is popular with hobbyist weavers. Currently most tablet weavers produce narrow work such as belts, straps, or garment trims.\n\n- Woven fabric is a textile formed by weaving . It is produced on a loom , and made of many threads woven on a warp and a weft .\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'woven fabric'.\n\nChoices:\n- area\n - art\n - band\n - census\n - city\n - cloth\n - community radio\n - complex\n - county\n - criticism\n - day\n - design\n - device\n - fiber\n - function\n - july\n - keep\n - machine\n - material\n - may\n - method\n - model\n - music\n - people\n - process\n - profit\n - programming\n - radio\n - radio station\n - range\n - service\n - shape\n - skill\n - state\n - station\n - study\n - tablet\n - tapestry\n - term\n - textile\n - the city\n - thread\n - three\n - two\n - united states census\n - weave\n - weaving\n - wire\n - word\n - yarn\n", "completion": "material<|endoftext|>"}

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway.

The gameplay of \"NBA Jam\" is based on \"Arch Rivals\", another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of \"NBA Jam\" that brought mainstream success to the genre.\n\n- Streetball or street basketball is a variation of basketball typically played on outdoor courts, featuring significantly less formal structure and enforcement of the game's rules. As such, its format is more conducive to allowing players to publicly showcase their own individual skills. Streetball (street basketball) is often regarded as another element of the Hip Hop culture. Streetball may also refer to other urban sports played on asphalt. It is particularly big in New York City.\n\n- Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek  \"\u00e1sphaltos\".\n\n- AND 1 Streetball is a streetball video game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, developed by Black Ops Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on June 6, 2006, in conjunction with the AND1 Mixtape Tour.

It began as a 1997 arcade game that was ported to home consoles and spawned several sequels. Rather than being designed as a realistic interpretation of the sport of football, like \"Madden NFL\" or \"NFL 2K\", the \"Blitz\" series was created as an over-the-top, exaggerated version of the sport, inspired by Midway's own \"NBA Jam\" basketball games.\n\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \"video\" in \"video game\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\n\n- NFL 2K is an American football video game series developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega. The series was originally exclusive to Sega's Dreamcast video game console due to the absence of EA Sports's Madden NFL series on the system. As the foremost \"2K\" title, it marked the beginning of a running athletics series that eventually led to the spinning off of 2K's sports publishing business under the name of 2K Sports. Upon the Dreamcast's discontinuation, the series continued to be published for other sixth generation game systems and became the chief competitor of the Madden series. \n\n- Madden NFL (known as John Madden Football before 1993) is an American football video game series developed by EA Tiburon for EA Sports. It is named after Pro Football Hall of Famer John Madden, a well-known former Super Bowlwinning coach of the Oakland Raiders and color commentator. The series has sold more than 100 million copies, and influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport. Among the game's realistic features are sophisticated playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary that allows players to hear the game as if it were a real TV broadcast. As of September 2013, the franchise generated over $4 billion in revenue.\n\n- Midway Games was an American video game developer and publisher. Its titles included \"Mortal Kombat\", \"Ms. Pac-Man\", \"Spy Hunter\", \"Tron\", \"Rampage\", the \"Cruis'n\" series, \"NFL Blitz\", and \"NBA Jam\". Midway also acquired the rights to video games that were originally developed by Williams Electronics and Atari Games, such as \"Defender\", \"Joust\", \"Robotron 2084\", \"Gauntlet\", and the \"Rush\" series.\n\n- Mortal Kombat is a video game franchise originally developed by Midway Games' Chicago studio in 1992. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the \"Mortal Kombat\" development team was acquired by Warner Bros. and turned into NetherRealm Studios. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment currently owns the rights of the franchise and rebooted it in 2011.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'developer' with the subject 'nba ballers'.\n\nChoices:\n- ancient\n - atari\n - black ops entertainment\n - ea sports\n - ea tiburon\n - gameloft\n - midway games\n - netherrealm studios\n - nintendo\n - produce\n - sony computer entertainment\n - success\n - ubisoft\n - visual concepts\n", "completion": "midway games<|endoftext|>"}

This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof. The name comes from the Medieval Latin word \"gamba\", meaning \"horse's hock or leg\". The term \"gambrel\" is of American origin, the older, European name being a curb (kerb, kirb) roof. Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a mansard roof but called both types a mansard.

The term was coined in 1808 by the early nineteenth century German educational reformer and theologian Friedrich Niethammer and gradually adopted into English. Niethammer had wished to introduce into German education the humane values of ancient Greece and Rome. Niethhammer was a Lutheran theologian. Since the twentieth century, however, Anglophone humanist movements have usually been aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.\n\n- Alfonso de Castro ( 1495 in Zamora , Spain -- February 11 , 1558 in Brussels , Belgium ) , known also as Alphonsus a Castro , was a Franciscan theologian and jurist .

He is the founder of the tradition in philosophy known as the School of Salamanca, noted especially for his contributions to the theory of just war and international law. He has in the past been described by some scholars as one of the \"fathers of international law\", along with Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius, though contemporary academics have suggested that such a description is anachronistic, since the concept of international law did not truly develop until much later. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Vitoria was \"the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas.\" Because of Vitoria's conception of a \"republic of the whole world\" (\"res publica totius orbis\") he recently has been labeled \"founder of global political philosophy\".\n\n- Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea.

Croagh Patrick is part of a longer east-west ridge; the westernmost peak is called Ben Gorm.\n\n- A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\n\n- Nephin or Nefin, at 806 metres (2646\u00a0ft), is the second-highest peak in Connacht (after Mweelrea), Ireland.

Goldman sought to raise esteem for concert bands among musicians and audiences. The reputations of concert bands suffered in comparison to symphony orchestras due to factors including \"the concert bands concert venue, often out-of-doors, the difficulty of conductors to obtain a quality music education, a limited repertoire that with the exception of marches was largely borrowed from the libraries of the orchestra, and a lack of camaraderie among the leading bandmasters/conductors of the period.\"\n\n- The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out.\nFrom the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military.

The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. \n\n- Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe.

Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. \n\n- A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \"in mothballs\" or \"mothballed\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \"ghost fleet\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \"laid up in ordinary\".\n\n- Monty Pythons Flying Circus (known during the final series as just Monty Python) is a British sketch comedy series created by the comedy group Monty Python and broadcast by the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent.\n\n- Edwin Franko Goldman (January 1, 1878  February 21, 1956) was an American composer and conductor.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house.\nResponsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \"floor\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.\n\n- Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America.

Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \"in Christ\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n- The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Li\u00e8ge, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands.

Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \"fens\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.\n\n- In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\"usually a municipality\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \"unit\u00e9 urbaine\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \"agglomeration\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself.\n\n- A reliquary (also referred to as a \"shrine\" or by the French term \"ch\u00e2sse\") is a container for relics.

Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.\nVirtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \"rabbi\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period.\n\n- Nonviolent resistance (NVR or nonviolent action) is the practice of achieving goals such as social change through symbolic protests, civil disobedience, economic or political noncooperation, satyagraha, or other methods, without using violence. This type of action highlights the desires of an individual or group that feels that something needs to change to improve the current condition of the resisting person or group. It is largely but wrongly taken as synonymous with civil resistance. Each of these terms (\"nonviolent resistance\" and \"civil resistance\") has its distinct merits and also quite different connotations and commitments.\n\n- Pora ! ( Ukrainian :  ! ) , meaning It 's time ! in Ukrainian , is a civic youth organization ( Black Pora ! ) and political party in Ukraine ( Yellow Pora ! ) espousing nonviolent resistance and advocating increased national democracy . The group was established in 2004 ( as only a civic youth organization ) to coordinate young people 's opposition to the Kuchma government in opposition to what they claimed was the authoritarian governing style of Ukraine 's president Leonid Kuchma . After the Orange Revolution Pora ! split up in two different entities , Black Pora ! ( since 2006 OPORA ) and Yellow Pora !\n\n- Kiev or Kyiv is the capital and largest city of Ukraine, located in the north central part of the country on the Dnieper River.

The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.\n\n- Violence is defined by the World Health Organization as \"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation\", although the group acknowledges that the inclusion of \"the use of power\" in its definition expands on the conventional understanding of the word. This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person).\nGlobally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\" He concluded: \"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.\nIn 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.\nViolence in many forms is preventable.

The peninsula is located south of the Ukrainian region of Kherson and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov.\n\n- Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \"continent\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.\n\n- Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu.\n\n- Eastern Europe, also known as East Europe, is the eastern part of the European continent. There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\". A related United Nations paper adds that \"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\".\n\n- Belarus ( lat. ', ), officially the Republic of Belarus, formerly known by its Russian name Byelorussia (though this name is no longer used in Belarus itself, even in Russian language), is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire.\n\n- The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

The term \"satyagraha\" was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (18691948). He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Martin Luther King, Jr.'s and James Bevel's campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States (19541968), and many other social justice and similar movements. Someone who practices satyagraha is a \nsatyagrahi.\n\n- Democracy (\"\" literally \"rule of the commoners\"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament. Democracy is sometimes referred to as \"rule of the majority\". Democracy was originally conceived in Classical Greece, where political representatives were chosen by a jury from amongst the male citizens: rich and poor.\n\n- Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.\n\n- Edward James Livingstone ( September 12 , 1884 -- September 11 , 1945 ) was a Canadian sports team owner and manager . He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association , where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League .\n\n- An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \"chieftain\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\"hertig\"/\"hertug\"/\"hertog\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \"jarl\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \"jarl\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \"Earl/Count\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.\n\n- The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada.\n\n- A global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, is a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. The concept comes from geography and urban studies, and the idea that globalization can be understood as largely created, facilitated, and enacted in strategic geographic locales according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.\n\n- Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.\n\n- The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. The regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes combined with the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The Greater Toronto Area is the northern part of the Golden Horseshoe.\n\n- A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \"Btss\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown.

With over 2.7\u00a0million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10\u00a0million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.\n\n- A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \"knighthood\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.\n\n- The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \"de facto\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \"de jure\" NHL championship prize in 1947.\n\n- The National Hockey Association (NHA), officially the \"National Hockey Association of Canada Limited\", was a professional ice hockey organization with teams in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. It is the direct predecessor to today's National Hockey League (NHL). Founded in 1909 by Ambrose O'Brien, the NHA introduced 'six-man hockey' by removing the 'rover' position in 1911. During its lifetime, the league coped with competition for players with the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the enlistment of players for World War I and disagreements between owners. The disagreements between owners came to a head in 1917, when the NHA suspended operations in order to get rid of an unwanted owner (Eddie Livingstone). The remaining NHA team owners started the NHL in parallel as a temporary measure, to continue play while negotiations went on with Livingstone and other lawsuits were pending. A year later, after no progress was reached with Livingstone, the other NHA owners decided to permanently suspend the NHA. The NHA's rules, constitution and trophies were continued in the NHL.\n\n- Los Angeles (Spanish for \"The Angels\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County.

Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.\n\n- In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \"goal crease\" (often referred to simply as \" the crease\" or \"the net\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.\n\n- The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\"\n\n- Choreography is the art or practice of designing sequences of movements of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which motion, form, or both are specified. \"Choreography\" may also refer to the design itself. A choreographer is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography, a process known as \"choreographing\". Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, cheerleading, cinematography, gymnastics, fashion shows, ice skating, marching band, show choir, theatre, synchronized swimming, cardistry, video game production and animated art. In the performing arts, choreography applies to human movement and form. In dance, choreography is also known as dance choreography or \"dance composition\".\n\n- A solo dance is danced by an individual dancing alone , as opposed to couples dancing together but independently of others dancing at the same time , if any , and as opposed to groups of people dancing simultaneously in a coordinated manner . Solo dancers are usually the best dancers in a group or dance school . Most solo dancers start after about 6 -- 7 years of dance or sooner . Most soloists are company kids of their dance school . They are usually in more than one dance . In Comparsas , there are various soloists who strut in front . They usually dance at the edges of the street so that the viewing public can appreciate their moves . Most male soloists carry a large lantern - like artifact on a large pole , resting on an oily pouch , which they make spin at will . Dance is a way to express emotions .\n\n- Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.\n\n- Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.\n\n- A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members often applaud.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'subclass of' with the subject 'solo dance'.\n\nChoices:\n- art\n - belief\n - choreography\n - cinematography\n - composition\n - culture\n - dance\n - design\n - domain\n - gymnastics\n - human\n - ice\n - ice skating\n - knowledge\n - law\n - man\n - material\n - member\n - motion\n - performance\n - performer\n - practice\n - process\n - production\n - setting\n - show\n - skating\n - society\n - space\n - swimming\n - theater\n - type\n - variety\n - venue\n", "completion": "performance<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one). The base-2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices. Each digit is referred to as a bit.\n\n- Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be \"text-only\", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \"Puzzle-free\", that focuses on narrative, and \"text adventures\" that focus on puzzles.\n\n- The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.\n\n- Magnetic Scrolls was a British video game developer active between 1984 and 1990. A pioneer of audiovisually elaborate text adventure games, it was one of the two largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s.\n\n- The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \"bit\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \"shannon\", named after Claude Shannon.\n\n- The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987.\n\n- A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 \u00d7 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory.\n\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \"video\" in \"video game\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\n\n- Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.\n\n- Range for storing integers.\nA 32-bit register can store 2 different values. The range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits depends on the integer representation used. With the two most common representations, the range is 0 through 4,294,967,295 (2 - 1) for representation as an (unsigned) binary number, and -2,147,483,648 (-2) through 2,147,483,647 (2 - 1) for representation as two's complement.\n\n- The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977.\n\n- The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations.\n\n- Jinxter is a text adventure video game developed by Magnetic Scrolls and published by Rainbird in 1987 for popular 8 - bit and 16 - bit machines of the time as well as for the 32 - bit Acorn Archimedes . Jinxter tells the story of a man on a mission to save the fictional land of Aquitania from the looming threat of evil witches . The game was well received by critics upon its release .\n\n- In computing, memory address is a data concept used at various levels by software and hardware to access the computer's primary storage memory. Memory addresses are fixed-length sequences of digits conventionally displayed and manipulated as unsigned integers. Such numerical semantic bases itself upon features of CPU (such as the instruction pointer and incremental address registers), as well upon use of the memory like an array endorsed by various programming languages.\n\n- Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, as well as a binary signed number representation based on this operation. Its wide use in computing makes it the most important example of a radix complement.\n\n- ARM, originally Acorn RISC Machine, later Advanced RISC Machine, is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. British company ARM Holdings develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products that implement one of those architecturesincluding systems-on-chips (SoC) that incorporate memory, interfaces, radios, etc. It also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products.\n\n- The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.\nThe size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The \"de facto\" standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. The international standard IEC 80000-13 codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'genre' with the subject 'jinxter'.\n\nChoices:\n- adventure\n - animal\n - art\n - basic\n - design\n - family\n - graphics\n - information\n - instruction\n - interactive fiction\n - mathematics\n - narrative\n - representation\n - various\n - video\n", "completion": "interactive fiction<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The term girdle, meaning \"belt\", commonly refers to the liturgical attire that normally closes a cassock in many Christian denominations, including the Anglican Communion, Methodist Church and Lutheran Church. The girdle, in the 8th or 9th century, was said to resemble an ancient Levitical Jewish vestment, and in that era, was not visible. In 800 AD, the girdle began to be worn by Christian deacons in the Eastern Church.\n\n- A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.\n\n- Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\n\n- Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules.\n\n- Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \"cut into sections\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.\n\n- Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature.\n\n- The Anglican Communion is an international association of autonomous churches consisting of the Church of England and national and regional Anglican churches (\"provinces\") in full communion with it. Full participation in the sacramental life of each church is available to all communicant Anglicans.\n\n- The cassock, or soutane, is an item of Christian clerical clothing used by the clergy of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Reformed churches, among others. \"Ankle-length garment\" is the literal meaning of the corresponding Latin term, \"vestis talaris\". It is related to habit traditionally worn by nuns, monks, and friars.\n\n- A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \"branches of Christianity\" or \"denominational families\".\n\n- A corset is a garment worn to hold and train the torso into a desired shape for aesthetic or medical purposes (either for the duration of wearing it or with a more lasting effect). Both men and women are known to wear corsets, though this item was for many years an integral part of women's wardrobes.\n\n- The Apocrita are a suborder of insects in the order Hymenoptera. It includes wasps, bees, and ants, and consists of many families. It contains the most advanced hymenopterans and is distinguished from Symphyta by the narrow \"waist\" (petiole) formed between the first two segments of the actual abdomen; the first abdominal segment is fused to the thorax, and is called the propodeum. Therefore, it is general practice, when discussing the body of an apocritan in a technical sense, to refer to the mesosoma and metasoma (or \"gaster\") rather than the \"thorax\" and \"abdomen\", respectively. The ovipositor of the female either extends freely or is retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defense and paralyzing prey. Larvae are legless and blind, and either feed inside a host (plant or animal) or in a nest cell provisioned by their mothers.\n\n- Wasp waist refers to a woman 's fashion silhouette , produced by a style of corset and girdle , that has experienced various periods of popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries . Its primary feature is the abrupt transition from a natural - width rib cage to an exceedingly small waist , with the hips curving out below . It takes its name from its similarity to a wasp 's segmented body . The sharply cinched waistline also exaggerates the hips and bust . In the 19th century , while average corseted waist measurements varied between 20 and 23 inches , wasp waist measurements of 16 to 18 inches were common and were often striven for as the reigning standard of feminine beauty in the period . Among the multitude of medical problems women suffered to achieve these drastic measurements were deformed ribs , weakened abdominal muscles , deformed and dislocated internal organs , and respiratory ailments . Displacement and disfigurement of the reproductive organs greatly increased the risk of miscarriage and maternal death .\n\n- Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- This list includes the Roman names of countries , or significant regions , known to the Roman Empire .\n\n- The Battle of Actium was the decisive confrontation of the Final War of the Roman Republic, a naval engagement between Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra on 2 September 31 BC, on the Ionian Sea near the promontory of Actium, in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus in Greece. Octavian's fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt.\n\n- Marcus Antonius (Latin: ; January\u00a014, August\u00a01, 30\u00a0BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire.\n\n- The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.\n\n- Rome is a city and special \"comune\" (named \"Roma Capitale\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \"comune\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3\u00a0million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. \n\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90\u00a0million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \"Augustus\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\n\n- Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100\u00a0BC  15 March 44\u00a0BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose.

Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\"empress consort\"), mother (\"empress dowager\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\"empress regnant\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \"Emperor\".\n\n- Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.\n\n- The Roman Senate was a political institution in ancient Rome. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries.\n\n- Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.\n\n- An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight\nabove it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'is a list of' with the subject 'list of latin names of countries'.\n\nChoices:\n- ancient\n - author\n - battle\n - capital\n - century\n - city\n - country\n - emperor\n - emperor of japan\n - monarch\n - politician\n - ruler\n - war\n - woman\n - year\n", "completion": "country<|endoftext|>"}

Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes. Black comedy corresponds to the earlier concept of gallows humor.\n\n- Comedy horror is a literary and film genre that combines elements of comedy and horror fiction. Comedy horror has been described as able to be categorized under three types: \"black comedy, parody and spoof.\" The genre almost inevitably crosses over with the black comedy genre. Comedy horror will often use satire on horror cliches as its main source of humour or take a story in a different perspective, such as \"The Cabin in the Woods\" and \"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\".\n\n- In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \"kmid\u00eda\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy.

The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes.

The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.\n\n- Famous Funnies is an American publication of the 1930s that represents what popular culture historians consider the first true American comic book, following seminal precursors.\n\n- Sean Chapman (born 2 June 1961) is an English actor. He is best known for playing Frank Cotton in Clive Barker's \"Hellraiser\", and its sequel, \"\". He is also known for voicing the character Sgt. Michael Sykes (callsigned \"Psycho\") in \"Crysis\" in 2007 and in \"Crysis Warhead\" in 2008.\n\n- A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \"single effect\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.\n\n- Kirsty Cotton is a fictional character from the \"Hellraiser\" series of films. Created by writer Clive Barker, she first appears in the 1987 film \"Hellraiser\" and is based upon the character of the same name from the novel \"The Hellbound Heart\".

The film describes her as being Larry Cotton's daughter while in the novel, she is simply a friend of his.\n\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\n\n- Books of Blood are a series of horror fiction collections written by the British author Clive Barker.\n\n- Clive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, film director, and visual artist best known for his work in both fantasy and horror fiction. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the \"Books of Blood\", which established him as a leading horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the \"Hellraiser\" and \"Candyman\" series. He was the Executive Producer of the film \"Gods and Monsters\".\n\n- A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.\n\n- An American comic book is a thin (typically 32-page) periodical containing primarily comics content.\n\n- A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\n\n- The Hellbound Heart is a horror novella by Clive Barker, first published in November 1986 by Dark Harvest in the third volume of their \"Night Visions\" anthology series, and notable for becoming the basis for the 1987 movie \"Hellraiser\" and its franchise. It was re-released as a stand-alone title by HarperCollins in 1988, after the success of the movie, along with an audiobook recorded by Clive Barker and published by Simon & Schuster Audioworks. It retains the gory, visceral style that Barker introduced in his series of collected short stories \"The Books of Blood\". The story focuses on a mystical puzzle box and the horror it wreaks on a family that is unfortunate enough to come across it.\n\n- Ashley Laurence (born May 28, 1966) is an American actress and artist. She is best known for her role as Kirsty Cotton in Clive Barker's quintessential horror classic: \"Hellraiser\" (1987) and its sequels \"\" (1988), \"\" (1992) and \"\" (2002). She is also known for her roles in \"Lightning Bug\" (2004) and \"Red\" (2008). She has been featured in several national advertising campaigns for Geico, Coors Lite, AT&T.\n\n- An audiobook (or talking book) is a recording of a text being read. A reading of the complete text is noted as \"unabridged\", while readings of a reduced version, or abridgement of the text are labeled as \"abridged\".\n\n- A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics.\nThere were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'is a list of' with the subject 'list of hellraiser characters'.\n\nChoices:\n- accident\n - actor\n - artist\n - audiobook\n - author\n - book\n - character\n - city\n - fictional character\n - film\n - genre\n - historian\n - language\n - magazine\n - merger\n - narrative\n - novel\n - novella\n - people\n - publication\n - short story\n - single\n - title\n - work\n - writer\n", "completion": "fictional character<|endoftext|>"}

Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'located in the administrative territorial entity' with the subject 'half moon '.\n\nChoices:\n- amsterdam\n - anne arundel county\n - arundel\n - baltimore\n - belgium\n - best\n - burnie\n - canton of schwyz\n - caribbean\n - centre\n - district\n - east\n - europe\n - france\n - holland\n - hudson\n - india\n - indian\n - italy\n - jersey\n - loon op zand\n - most\n - netherlands\n - new jersey\n - new town\n - normal\n - north brabant\n - northern\n - northwest\n - of\n - oral\n - river\n - rotterdam\n - schwyz\n - south\n - switzerland\n - thompson\n - time\n - utrecht\n - van\n - west\n - york\n", "completion": "loon op zand<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Nucleic acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential to all known forms of life. They are composed of monomers, which are nucleotides made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is a simple ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).\n\n- Dynamite is an explosive made of nitroglycerin, sorbents (such as powdered shells or clay) and stabilizers. It was invented by the Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel in Geesthacht, and patented in 1867. It rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safer alternative to gun powder and nitroglycerin.\n\n- Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \"medicine\" is derived from Latin \"medicus\", meaning \"a physician\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.\n\n- Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.\n\n- Graphite, archaically referred to as plumbago, is a crystalline form of carbon, a semimetal, a native element mineral, and one of the allotropes of carbon. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds.\n\n- A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \"molecule\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions.\n\n- Francis Harry Compton Crick (8 June 1916  28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist, most noted for being a co-discoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule in 1953 with James Watson. Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\n- Raymond G. Gosling (15 July 1926  18 May 2015) was a British scientist who deduced the structure of DNA with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College, London.\n\n- The Nobel Foundation is a private institution founded on 29 June 1900 to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. The Foundation is based on the last will of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.\n\n- The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal.\n\n- Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins (15 December 1916  5 October 2004) was a New Zealand-born British physicist and molecular biologist, and Nobel laureate whose research contributed to the scientific understanding of phosphorescence, isotope separation, optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and to the development of radar. He is best known for his work at King's College London on the structure of DNA.\n\n- X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3\u00d710 Hz to 3\u00d710 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning R\u00f6ntgen radiation, after the German (German-Dutch to be precise) scientist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it \"X-radiation\" to signify an unknown type of radiation. Spelling of \"X-ray(s)\" in the English language includes the variants \"x-ray(s)\", \"xray(s)\", and \"X ray(s)\".\n\n- Alfred Bernhard Nobel (21 October 1833  10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist.\n\n- Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.\n\n- Alexander ( Alec ) Rawson Stokes ( 27 June 1919 -- 5 February 2003 ) was a co-author of the second of the three papers published sequentially in Nature on 25 April 1953 announcing the presumed molecular structure of DNA . The first was authored by Francis Crick and James Watson , and the third by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling . The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1962 to Crick , Watson and Wilkins for this work . In 1993 , on the 40th anniversary of the publication of the molecular structure of DNA , a plaque was erected in the Quad ( courtyard ) of the Strand campus of King 's College London commemorating the contributions of Franklin , Gosling , Stokes , Wilson and Wilkins to DNA X-ray diffraction studies .\n\n- Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time.\n\n- A chemist (from Greek chm (\u00eda) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.\n\n- Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.\n\n- A diploma (from Greek \u00b5 \"d\u00edplma\", meaning \"folded paper\") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded. In some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Australia, the word diploma also refers to an academic award (e.g. diploma of higher education, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma). Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the \"Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus\".\n\n- James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin. Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\n- Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 192016 April 1958) was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made contributions to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognized posthumously.\n\n- The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \"Nobelpriset\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'alex stokes'.\n\nChoices:\n- academic\n - carbon\n - chemist\n - crystallographer\n - diplomacy\n - discoverer\n - inventor\n - king\n - major\n - molecular biologist\n - official\n - philanthropist\n - physicist\n - physics\n - physiology\n - research\n - science\n - scientist\n", "completion": "physicist<|endoftext|>"}

He received his doctorate from the University of Michigan . During the course of his career he taught at Vassar College , Ohio State University , and Brandeis University . He married Margaret Weitz , a notable academic on French issues . Their son , Richard Weitz , is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute . Weitz ' groundbreaking publication is titled `` The Role of Theory in Aesthetics . '' This work arguably spurred much debate within the philosophy of art and is part of a larger movement known as anti-essentialism . This movement was popular in the 1950s and is similarly defended by W.B. Gallie , W.E. Kennick , and Paul Ziff . Weitz 's piece , however , is arguably the most popular anti-essentialist pieces , as well as one of the most debated pieces in twentieth century aesthetics . Weitz argued against the traditional essentialist methodology and proposed using Wittgenstein 's family resemblance argument as an alternate method for identifying art objects . Weitz proposed that in asking `` what is art ? '' aestheticians were really asking the wrong question altogether . The question he believed needed to be fundamentally addressed instead was `` what kind of concept is ' art ' ? '' Weitz used this question to propel both his defense of Wittgensteinian family resemblances , as well as his defense of art as an `` open concept . '' Weitz is widely considered to have renewed interest within the analytical philosophy for aesthetics , where his claims have been challenged for over fifty years , most famously by Maurice Mandelbaum in the 1965 article `` Family Resemblances and Generalizations Concerning the Arts . '' Weitz later developed a philosophy of criticism , in which the critic must describe , interpret , evaluate , and finally theorize about the work in question .\n\n- The Ohio State University, commonly referred to as Ohio State or OSU, is a public university in Columbus, Ohio. Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862, the university was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mech). The college began with a focus on training students in various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but was developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of Governor Rutherford B.

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The Bluest Eye was written by Toni Morrison in 1970. A single mother of two sons, Morrison wrote the novel while she was teaching at Howard University . She centers the story around a young African American girl named Pecola who grows up during the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio. Due to her dark skin color, Pecola gets taunted for her appearance as the members of her community associate beauty with \"whiteness\". She ultimately develops an inferiority complex, which fuels her desire for blue eyes. The point of view switches between the perspective of Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of Pecola's foster parents, and multiple third-person limited viewpoints. Due to the controversial issues the book raises such as racism, incest, and child molestation, there have been numerous attempts to ban it from schools and libraries.\n\n- Love ( 2003 ) is the eighth novel written by Toni Morrison . Written in Morrison 's non-linear style , the novel tells of the lives of several women and their relationships to the late Bill Cosey . Love is the story of Bill Cosey , a charismatic but dead hotel owner . Or rather , it is about the people around him , all affected by his life -- even long after his death . The main characters are Christine , his granddaughter and Heed , his widow . The two are the same age and used to be friends but some forty years after Cosey 's death they are sworn enemies , and yet share his mansion . Again Morrison used split narrative and jumps back and forth throughout the story , not fully unfolding until the very end . The characters in the novel all have some relation to the infamous Bill Cosey . Similar to the concept of communication between the living and the dead in Beloved , Morrison introduced a character named Junior ; she was the medium to connect the dead Bill Cosey to the world of the living . The storytelling techniques in Love , namely the split narrative , suggest a recent trend in Morrison 's literature that divides the plot among different time periods .

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Historical fiction is a literary genre in which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past. Historical fiction can be an ambiguous term: frequently it is used as a synonym for describing the historical novel; however, the term can be applied to works in other narrative formats, such as those in the performing and visual arts like theatre, opera, cinema, television, comics, and graphic novels.\n\n- Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \"literary\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.\n\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\n\n- Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \"The Time Machine\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\n\n- An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one .\n\n- Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities.\n\n- Alternate history or alternative history (British English), sometimes abbreviated as AH, is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently. These stories usually contain \"what if\" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record. The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on scientific fact. Alternate history can be seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres. Another term occasionally used for the genre is \"allohistory\" (literally \"other history\").\n\n- A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \"screen names\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.\n\n- Alexander Zorich is the collective pen name of two Russo - Ukrainian writers ; Yana Botsman and Dmitry Gordevsky . The two write in Russian , in genres such as science fiction , fantasy and alternate history , as well as PC game scenarios .\n\n- A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \"video\" in \"video game\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.\n\n- Technology (\"science of craft\", from Greek , \"techne\", \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and , \"-logia\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.\n\n- Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\n\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \"literature of ideas.\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\n\n- A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.\n\n- PC games, also known as computer games or personal computer games, are video games played on a personal computer rather than a dedicated video game console or arcade machine. Their defining characteristics include a lack of any centralized controlling authority, a greater degree of user control over the video-gaming hardware and software used and a generally greater capacity in input, processing, and output.\n\n- The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \"superntrlis\": \"supra\" \"above\" + \"naturalis\" \"natural\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.\n\n- Innovation can be defined simply as a \"new idea, device, or method\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \"innovation\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \"breaks into\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation.\n\n- Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \"speculative literature\".\n\n- A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.\n\n- A pen name (\"nom de plume\", or \"literary double\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \"real\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.\n\n- Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \"extraterrestrial\" or \"alien\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology.\n\n- Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \"Islands of Space\" in \"Astounding Science Fiction\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \"hard\" (natural) and \"soft\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'alexander zorich'.\n\nChoices:\n- author\n - computer\n - engineering\n - game\n - literary\n - magic\n - opera\n - physics\n - printer\n - prior\n - science\n - superhero\n - television\n - travel\n - writer\n", "completion": "author<|endoftext|>"}

Its borders were the Danube to the north, \"Raetia\" and \"Vindelicia\" to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and \"Italia\" (\"Venetia et Histria\") to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.\n\n- The Pontifex Maximus (Latin, literally: \"greatest pontiff\" or \"greatest bridge-builder\") was the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (\"Collegium Pontificum\") in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian (reigned 375383) who, however, then decided to omit the words \"pontifex maximus\" from his title. Although the most influential office within Roman priesthood, the \"pontifex maximus\" was ranked the fifth in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (\"ordo sacerdotum\"), behind the \"rex sacrorum\" and the \"flamines maiores\" (\"Flamen Dialis\", \"Flamen Martialis\", \"Flamen Quirinalis\").\n\n- Istria (Croatian, Slovene: \"Istra\"; Istriot: \"E\u00eestria\"; German: \"Istrien\"), formerly \"Histria\" (Latin), is the largest peninsula in the Adriatic Sea.

They were sons of Carus, a general raised to the office of praetorian prefect under Emperor Probus in 282.\n\n- The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \"emperor\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \"Augustus\" or \"Caesar\". Another title often used was \"imperator\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \"princeps\" (first citizen).

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.\n\n- Carus (c. 222  July or August 283) was Roman Emperor from 282 to 283, and was 60 at ascension. During his short reign, Carus fought the Germanic tribes and Sarmatians along the Danube frontier with success. He brought stability in the empire and died in 283 aged 61.\n\n- The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90\u00a0million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \"Augustus\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'date of death' with the subject 'pelagius of constance'.\n\nChoices:\n- 1\n - 10\n - 14\n - 19 august 14\n - 2\n - 20\n - 2009\n - 2011\n - 205\n - 222\n - 23\n - 237\n - 254\n - 27\n - 28\n - 283\n - 284\n - 285\n - 300\n - 375\n - 383\n - 4\n - 400\n - 500\n - 61\n - 7\n - 792\n - 875\n - 90\n", "completion": "283<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- In topology, knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R (in topology, a circle isn't bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.\n\n- In geometry, Euclidean space encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, and certain other spaces. It is named after the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria. The term \"Euclidean\" distinguishes these spaces from other types of spaces considered in modern geometry. Euclidean spaces also generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n- In the mathematical subject of topology, an ambient isotopy, also called an \"h-isotopy\", is a kind of continuous distortion of an \"ambient space\", a manifold, taking a submanifold to another submanifold. For example in knot theory, one considers two knots the same if one can distort one knot into the other without breaking it. Such a distortion is an example of an ambient isotopy. More precisely, let \"N\" and \"M\" be manifolds and \"g\" and \"h\" be embeddings of \"N\" in \"M\". A continuous map \nis defined to be an ambient isotopy taking \"g\" to \"h\" if \"F\" is the identity map, each map \"F\" is a homeomorphism from \"M\" to itself, and \"F\"  \"g\" = \"h\". This implies that the orientation must be preserved by ambient isotopies. For example, two knots which are mirror images of each other are in general not equivalent.\n\n- The State University of New York at Buffalo is a public research university with campuses in Buffalo and Amherst, New York, United States. It is commonly referred to as the University at Buffalo (UB) or SUNY Buffalo, and it was formerly known as the University of Buffalo. The university was founded in 1846 as a private college, but in 1962 merged with the State University of New York (SUNY) system. By enrollment, UB is the largest in the SUNY system, and also the largest public university in the northeastern United States (consisting of New York state and the New England region). UB also has the largest endowment and research funding, as a comprehensive university center in the SUNY system.\n\n- In mathematics, an embedding (or imbedding) is one instance of some mathematical structure contained within another instance, such as a group that is a subgroup.\n\n- In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.\n\n- A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \"real world\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. \n\n- William W. Menasco is a topologist and a professor at the University at Buffalo . He is best known for his work in knot theory .\n\n- The State University of New York (SUNY ) is a system of public institutions of higher education in New York, United States. It is one of the largest comprehensive systems of universities, colleges, and community colleges in the United States, with a total enrollment of 465,000 students, plus 1.1 million adult education students, spanning 64 campuses across the state. Led by Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher, the SUNY system has 88,000 faculty members and some 7,660 degree and certificate programs overall and a $10.7 billion budget. SUNY includes many institutions and four University Centers: Albany (1844), Buffalo (1846), Binghamton (1946), and Stony Brook (1957). SUNY's administrative offices are in Albany, the state's capital, with satellite offices in Manhattan and Washington, D.C. SUNY's largest campus is the University at Buffalo, which also has the greatest endowment and research funding.\n\n- In the mathematical field of topology, a homeomorphism or topological isomorphism or bi continuous function is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spacesthat is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The word \"homeomorphism\" comes from the Greek words \"\" (\"homoios\") = similar and \"\" (\"morph\") = shape, form.\n\n- A circle is a simple closed shape in Euclidean geometry. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius.\n\n- In mathematics, topology (from the Greek , \"place\", and , \"study\") is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. This can be studied by considering a collection of subsets, called open sets, that satisfy certain properties, turning the given set into what is known as a topological space. Important topological properties include connectedness and compactness.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'field of work' with the subject 'william menasco'.\n\nChoices:\n- education\n - geometry\n - knot theory\n - language\n - mathematics\n - physics\n - research\n - topology\n - track\n - training\n", "completion": "topology<|endoftext|>"}

Shortly after the completion of the occupation on 10 October 1938, the Nazis reorganised the administration in the region, forming the \"Reichsgau Sudetenland\".\n\n- The Munich Agreement was a settlement permitting Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation \"Sudetenland\" was coined. The agreement was signed in the early hours of 30 September 1938 (but dated 29 September) after being negotiated at a conference held in Munich, Germany, among the major powers of Europe, excluding the Soviet Union. Today, it is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement toward Germany. The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future of the Sudetenland in the face of ethnic demands made by Adolf Hitler. The agreement was signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to Czechoslovakia, as most of its border defenses, and banks were situated there, as well as heavy industrial districts. Part of the borderland was invaded and annexed by Poland.\n\n- NSTG Aussig was an ethnically - German football club from what was known as the town of Aussig , Sudetenland and is today \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem , Czech Republic .

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- George A. Wotherspoon is famous for his optical illusion art prints . He is a contemporary of Charles Allan Gilbert , and many of Wotherspoon 's works are falsely attributed to him . His works include : Gossip : And Satan Came Also Social Donkey\n\n- An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books.\n\n- An illusion is a distortion of the senses, revealing how the brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Though illusions distort reality, they are generally shared by most people.\nIllusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.\nSome illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual's capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside of the body within ones physical environment.\n\n- Memento mori (\"remember that you have to die\") is a Latin expression, originating from a practice common in Ancient Rome; as a general came back victorious from a battle, and during his parade (\"Triumph\") received compliments and honors from the crowd of citizens, he ran the risk of falling victim to haughtiness and delusions of grandeur; to avoid it, a slave stationed behind him would say \"Respice post te. Hominem te memento\" (\"Look after you [to the time after your death] and remember you're [only] a man.\"). It was then reused during the medieval period, it is also related to the \"ars moriendi\" (\"The Art of Dying\") and related literature. \"Memento mori\" has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife.\n\n- An optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. There are three main types: literal optical illusions that create images that are different from the objects that make them, physiological illusions that are the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific type (brightness, colour, size, position, tilt, movement), and cognitive illusions, the result of unconscious inferences. Pathological visual illusions arise from a pathological exaggeration in physiological visual perception mechanisms causing the aforementioned types of illusions.\n\n- Vanitas is a category of symbolic works of art, especially those associated with the still life paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries in Flanders and the Netherlands. The Latin noun \"vntas\", (\"tis\", f. \"vanus\") means \"emptiness\", from the Latin adjective \"vanus\", meaning empty, and thus refers in this context to the traditional Christian view of earthly life and the worthless nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. In Christian philosophy, the word \"vanitas\" derives its prominence from the Ecclesiastes, and in the Vulgate the verse is rendered as \"Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas\". In the King James Version, however, it is translated , and therefore the English word \"vanity\" is used in its older (especially pre-14th century) sense of \"futility\".\n\n- Charles Allan Gilbert (September 3, 1873  April 20, 1929), better known as C. Allan Gilbert, was a prominent American illustrator. He is especially remembered for a widely published drawing (a memento mori or vanitas) titled \"All Is Vanity\". The drawing employs a double image (or visual pun) in which the scene of a woman admiring herself in a mirror, when viewed from a distance, appears to be a human skull. The title is also a pun, as this type of dressing-table is also known as a vanity. The phrase \"All is vanity\" comes from Ecclesiastes 1:2 (\"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.\") It refers to the vanity and pride of man. In art, vanity has long been represented as a woman preoccupied with her beauty. And art that contains a human skull as a focal point is called a memento mori (Latin for \"remember you will die\"), a work that reminds people of their mortality.\n\n- Ecclesiastes (Greek: , \"Ekklsiasts\", , \"Kohelet\", \"Qoheleth\") is one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, where it is classified as one of the \"Ketuvim\" (or \"Writings\"). It is among the canonical Wisdom Books in the Old Testament of most denominations of Christianity. The title \"Ecclesiastes\" is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Kohelet (meaning \"Gatherer\", but traditionally translated as \"Teacher\" or \"Preacher\"), the pseudonym used by the author of the book.\n\n\n\nGiven the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'occupation' with the subject 'george a. wotherspoon'.\n\nChoices:\n- artist\n - ascetic\n - author\n - drawing\n - general\n - illustrator\n - king\n - slave\n - translation\n - ventriloquist\n", "completion": "artist<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \"Star Wars\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company).\n\n- Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \"literature of ideas.\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.\n\n- Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \"speculative literature\".\n\n- Ballantine Books is a major book publisher located in the United States, founded in 1952 by Ian Ballantine with his wife, Betty Ballantine.

Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \"The Time Machine\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.\n\n- The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media.\n\n- Lucasfilm Ltd.

The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of $4.06 billion.\n\n- Dragonriders of Pern is a science fiction series written primarily by American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey, who initiated it in 1967. Beginning 2003, her middle child Todd McCaffrey has written Pern novels, both solo and jointly with Anne. The series (as of June 2011) comprises 22 novels and several short stories. Most of the short fiction has been collected in two volumes or incorporated in one of the novels, so \"Dragonriders of Pern\" is sometimes identified with the 24 books. Two of the novellas included in the first novel, \"Dragonflight\", made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award.\n\n- Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915\u00a0 May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey.\n\n- The term \"manga\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana:  or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \"Manga\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan.\n\n- The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \"superntrlis\": \"supra\" \"above\" + \"naturalis\" \"natural\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.\n\n- Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann.

It is a fix-up of novellas, including two which made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award.\n\n- Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\n\n- The White Dragon is a science fiction novel by American - Irish author Anne McCaffrey .

{"prompt": "Information:\n\n- The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas.\n\n- The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. \n\n- Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty .
