With the OneLove band we express this message,\u201d said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.\n\u201cOn behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now. It is good to see that other countries are joining this initiative.\u201d\nOneLove was founded in the Netherlands in 2020 to emphasize that all football fans have at least one thing in common \u2013 their love of football \u2013 and to speak out against any form of discrimination.\nAs well as focusing on public messaging, the initiative has also developed to offer diversity training to grassroots club.\n\u201cOur love of football unites us all. No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,\u201d said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n\u201cI am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.\u201d\nIn June, England\u2019s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark\u2019s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n\u201cI am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "You are given some reviews for a movie. Each video might have mentioned some negative or positive points about the movie. Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points.\n\nInput: Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach."}

We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to come back and look at these materials. This section should not take you an entire week.\n- Installing and Using Python\nIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.\n- Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)\nIn the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\n- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions\nIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.\n- Chapter Three: Conditional Code\nIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."}

It's mainly made from recycled parts.\nWhen a 1.5 volt battery is new it will probably have more than 1.5 volts in it. As the battery is used the voltage will decrease until the voltage is not enough to run the application ( E.g. a red LED) and will be called 'dead' . But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage. The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit. The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.\nHere is the required steps:\n1- Connect a switch to a battery holder. A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.\n2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.\n3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.\n4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts)\n5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts)\n6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.\n7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.\n8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up."}

It also needs to rotate on itself. Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can. This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can."}

throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."}

"Submodalities\nGiving a physical form to your anxiety can help your mind feel more in control of it. In this exercise, we will visualize what anxiety looks and feels like, and learn to reduce its intensity. Here are the questions that you need to answer:\n1- Everyone feels anxiety differently. Where in your body do you feel it?\n2- Now close your eyes and picture your anxiety. Try to give it color, shape, and temperature. What does it feel like?\n3- Does it move, or is it in one place? If it moves, tell how it is moving.\n4- Now for the good part, close your eyes and try changing this picture. Change how it moves. Slow it done shrink its size. Try to move it away from your body. Imagine it fading. Keep doing this until you feel like you can change how it feels. Changing which submodality helped you curb your anxiety? Was it its shape, size, or something else?\n5- Do you feel better now?"}

{"prompt": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\nOutput:", "instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.", "input": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention.

In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "response": "\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nCreate a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.", "target": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, and guides slot with explicit intent information and proposes a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing."}

possible to hire highly creative people who live further away if they don't have to come into the office every day.\n- People who aren't distracted by office noises and regular interruptions will perform better. \n- Team members' communication skills will improve, as they will learn to communicate more effectively using email and IM, for example. \n\nCons:\n- It may be more difficult for team members to build meaningful, productive, creative relationships with one another.\n- The organization would have to budget for equipment that team members can take home.\n- The organization may not be able to keep track of how people spend their time. \n- The company could lose control of its data, because equipment and documents are removed from the office.\n- It will be harder to schedule face-to-face meetings and provide constructive feedback."}
